I had to pay extra 75 CAD at each airport. None of them accepted cash. In Toronto, the payment machine did not recognise my Visa card. I was sent to another counter where they issued a card with 75 dollars in it plus 9 CAD for the service. In Sofia, the card worked but instead of 101 units in local currency, I was charged 101 CAD (I lost another 26 dollars). One may say 35 dollars lost is not a big deal. True, but the problem is with the nerves. On top of the stress with checking in, security check and wasting time (you must be at the airport 3 hours before the departure time and departure was late by a whole hour) comes the stupid requirement to pay separately for the luggage. Not online or within the ticket price, but at the airport. Never again Lufthansa."

The flight was almost completely full. On this 12-hour flight, we were placed in seats next to a partition, with no possibility of any movement to recline the backrest. The seat was only completely vertical. I spoke with the flight attendants about the problem. I noticed that there were 10 or 15 free seats in economy-plus / premium economy. I talked to the team again, I spoke about the discomfort of traveling for 12 hours in that seat, but they were totally inflexible. The 10-15 economy-plus seats were empty for the entire flight, and we had the backrest upright. The lack of flexibility and understanding of this discomfort on the part of the onboard team was astonishing."

They delayed flight and caused me to miss the connecting trip, which I also booked from Lufthansa (bus express). In addition, I lost my baggage because of it and nobody at the customer service point could help out. Person A (from Lufthansa) would say a completely different thing to person B, and so on (I talked to a number of Lufthansa employees, and each of them said different things). I had to get my connecting bus ticket three times (they made me miss my bus three times because of my lost luggage). The worst was when I was approaching one of the employees and with a very unfriendly tone, she said: ""Nobody can help you now. Come back tomorrow morning."" I was roaming around the airport at midnight for hours asking them and that's what they told me. They even do not give me any compensation during the lost baggage period. Extremely disappointing."

Lost luggage, said they would pay 50% of costs for clothing for two small kids and an adult - not sure what law that represents. The worst is that the official helpline is utterly terrible. I've spent short of 6 hours trying to get through to someone. The end result is that the helpline for baggage is ""just an information centre"" and can't actually tell me where our lost kids clothes are. They ""make a request"". This is abysmal."

Delay to incoming flight resulted in a two hour delay in departure. No information or explanation given other continued changes to departure time on boards. Boarding procedures chaotic. Although cabin bag size restriction is published, this was not enforced, leading difficulties in place correct sized bags in overhead lockers. Choice of food available for purchase on board very poor. Cabin staff unhelpful. Information given re onward flight affected by delay given re other flights but not to London Heathrow. On arrival in Frankfurt no stand available causing further delay, when stand was allocated, plane had to move to another since offloading equipment was in the wrong place! Before disembarking told London flight was being held for 15 minutes. After a race across the concourse, arrived at gate in time to board, only to be told flight had already closed no information. Gate staff officious, rude and unhelpful. Do help with any information as to how to re book onward flight, or when that might be. Eventually given new boarding passes for flight already boarding, so another dash to new gate."

When dropping off the bag at LH in Munich I was informed that my original seat has an issue with its electronic and as a precaution I was assigned a different seat. The check in agent then rearranged both my wife's and my seat to perfect different couple seat and all was really super. I was impressed that Lufthansa realised that there is a seat issue in advance and proactively cleared all issues. Boarding on the 15th of June for LH 494 was not as smooth as it could have been but acceptable. In flight service was top notch with very friendly and efficient attendants, meals very very well presented and of the highest quality. Plane was clean and in-flight entertainment good. LH Business Class seats are a matter of taste and admittedly I prefer those to the cocoon like atmosphere of others and when travelling as a couple just perfect. Choosing D and G seats will also eliminate the aisle access issue. Plane landed a bit before the scheduled time. A very pleasant flight."

However for this short flight it was adequate. Service onboard was friendly, if a little mechanical. Food served was pretty nice with very tender beef with mashed celeriac and, a chocolate pudding and delicious bread roll and butter. A wide choice of drinks were offered, wine, beer, soft drinks, tea coffee etc. The flight attendant came around several times on this short flight offering further drinks and tidying up.

Our flights were reasonably on time and flight attendants on both legs were pleasant and attentive. We were given a small bottle of water and a tasty Lufthansa branded chocolate.

On my way from Canada I had no issues. Everyone was lovely and things were okay. On my way back from Nice to canada. The staff asked me to pay for my carry on luggage as the measurements were bigger than usual. I informed them that I had no issues coming to nice with that same luggage and was checked in by a Lufthansa employee. The customer service at Nice airport was horrible. I should’ve been informed of this when I was departing from Canada.  There are no real standards or rules. And obviously it varies from airport to airport, which is extremely stressful.  This was a Lufthansa staff error. & they still had me pay for the bag."

Cabin crew was not approachable or friendly, almost felt like they have been sent to do their jobs on gunpoint. Ran out of food options too quick and what we got was inedible by any standards. Seats were very hard and uncomfortable, pillow case and blankets were very dirty. Tray table was not cleaned. Worst of all, no headphones were provided on a 10 hour flight nor was the WiFi working.

17,✅ Trip Verified ,D Parker,France,12th June 2023,"!frequent flyer programme atrocious""",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Bangalore via Frankfurt,December 2022,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3,no,5," I flew Lufthansa three times last year (twice to India and once to Japan). The India flights were, rather surprisingly, alright, and the Japan one less so. But my problem is not with the flights themselves, but rather with Lufthansa's frequent flyer programme ('miles & more'), which is simply atrocious. First of all, there is no possibility anywhere of interacting with a human being. For some reason, the flight mileage is seemingly arbitrary. Whereas my daughter and I flew together, she got no mileage for two of her four flights and I got nothing for one (a different) sector. How do you fix this? Well, you go to their website and scan in your boarding pass and submit the request. You get a cryptic (by that I mean idiotic) ""reply"" but you cannot reply to that and ask for a clarification! All you can do is to redo the same thing you just did. Secondly, I just tried looking to see how much credit I could get with my miles towards a ticket for my kids. How do you do this? Well, you login to the miles & more website and ask for a flight on the dates of interest. Back a message saying that unfortunately no tickets are available for the dates requested, but perhaps changing the dates might help, alongside a helpful link back to the previous page, instead of showing you a grill with availability on dates a week before or after. So you go back to the previous page and has it kept your data? Of course not! They clearly do not want you to use your mileage. It's truly pathetic and unworthy of a major airline."

Paid for upgraded seats - given the two middle seats of a row of four - hideous when going to the bathroom several times over a long flight. Cabin crew annoyed that we were not happy about our money being stolen by their company for services not given. Practically threw our food and drink at us the whole flight - it was ordinary at best anyway. To give credit we did arrive more or less on time and safely so really that is what you ultimately want. However then ensued several months of emails trying to at least get a refund for the services not supplied - no joy with this and in fact some very weird emails promising refunds which never materialised. What a waste of time - would never fly with Lufthansa again and definitely would not recommend. I'm was really surprised that the German national air carrier is so abysmal!

The ground steward confirmed that I have this seat. However, when I boarded, I was given a different seat. The flight attendant apologized and said that I should reach out for the customers' care for reimbursement. I sent 4 letters to customers' care, each time required to provide more explanations for this very simple event. Finally, they answered that the company does not take any responsibility for this and that they will not reimburse me. Bottom line: bought something that was not provided and was not reimbursed. I find this unacceptable."

Real problem was the luggage. Had to pay 500 euros extra for 2 extra suitcases (OK) but our stroller/baby car went for free. This stroller/baby car consists of 2 parts, the bed and the frame with wheels. The frame with wheels never arrived in Sao Paulo (due to Brazilian law you have to pick up your luggage at the first entry in Brazil). Made a report via the Lufthansa website and then it's waiting but nothing happened. Called the luggage department 3 times and they just tell you to wait. Although they ask about a list of contents, which I already filled in . They gave me an email address to mail to send the pictures to, afterwards you get a nice email confirmation. But the pictures are never added to case! After 5 days still nothing. It looks like the luggage department can't just call Frankfurt and asked if it arrived there, then call Sao Paulo or Amsterdam lost luggage (only 3 calls or 3 computer systems, that shouldn't be that difficult). During the calls they constantly ask you for the list of contents, which I filled in off-course, but you can't upload of picture of the lost item (then it would be found pretty quickly). Yes, I can claim 50% of the value, but strollers in Brazil are different and not as good. They should just find the stroller frame with wheels. If the bed part can arrive, why not the stroller? So flying with Lufthansa can be fine or cheap, but if you luggage is lost, you are doomed and can't even speak to somebody normal."

Normally we would board in Vancouver 4th of June at 11am to start a cruise. Our flight in Brussels had a delay of 70 minutes, so we missed our connection in Frankfurt. Still on the plane, taxiing to the gate, we received an email that our flight to Vancouver was rebooked to Monday 5th June, that was not ok because the cruise started on the 4th. At the customer desk, after a waiting time of 90 minutes, the lady was very rude, she gave us a flight with a stopover in Chicago and a (theoretical) arrival in Vancouver on the 4th at 11h 33am. That was too late, by no means we could arrive on time to board our cruise ship (11am). The lady was constantly pointing her watch to make clear that her shift was over, she only spent 10 minutes to solve our problem. She threw the new flight schedule on the desk, turned around and went away. I was totally in shock. In our life we have made a lot of travels to all kind of continents and with all kind of carriers. Never, never were we treated in such a brutal, disrespectful manner. We took a train back home, a sad ending of our dream cruise. I would not recommend travelling with Lufthansa."

They are charging premium prices but lacking the premium experience. The food was terrible, the seats were cramped and uncomfortable. WiFi came at a premium even for messages only. Many of the changes made by Lufthansa over the years remind me of budget airlines like easy jet. The very reason I flew with Lufthansa was the more Premium experience, such as being able to choose a seat on check-in free of charge. Ironically, the flight to San Francisco, our first stop on a road trip, was with United who had great food, very generous service and comfortable seats. It's sad seeing what's happened to this once great airline."

Lufthansa has completely lost it. Under the pretext of COVID, Lufthansa has become extremely cheap. I have been a miles and more loyal passenger for at least a decade. During booking the lady was extremely rude and would not confirm if tickets were refundable if cancelled within 24 hours. In Washington and in Frankfurt the food was extremely sub standard and choices limited and on both flights I was not given the special meal that I had ordered. I have specific dietary requirements and despite confirming the meal twice before travel, they messed up my meal. During my flight from Frankfurt to Riyadh, the boarding was a horror. Passengers were not segregated according to class and it was almost a free for all. The ground staff was extremely rude. I requested that lady that perhaps passengers could be segregated according to class and made to board according to zones. To which she replied sarcastically how thankful she was to learn from me. I wrote several emails to Lufthansa asking them to address this and never got a reply. "

I missed a step when I was originally booking online and I ended up booking my seat from Barcelona to Munich and not from Munich to Vancouver. I was willing to pay for my seat.  I didn’t have roaming on my phone so I used my friends phone. I googled how to reach Lufthansa from Spain. I couldn’t call their 1800 customer service number because it didn’t work from Spain. I googled everything from what area codes to use from Spain to call Lufthansa using a Canadian phone. Well let me tell you with all this technology these companies have they don’t make it easy on the customer. It’s not enough we have us do all the work ourselves when booking tickets and checking in, but its hard reaching customer service when you need them. Their online system is not user friendly and when it tells you to contact Lufthansa directly, but they don’t offer you a phone number let alone a number for calling from Spain or other foreign countries even though they have offices in these countries. After I managed to find their number on Google and it said it was Lufthansa’s number I ended up calling the Barcelona Airport. Finally, I did reach Lufthansa’s offices in Madrid. This woman picked it up and she was speaking in Spanish. I asked her if anybody there speaks English because I know no Spanish. As soon as I said that her attitude changed. She kept telling me that she didn’t speak English. I asked if some else there did? She said nobody. I told her all I wanted to do was book my seat, but she kept telling me to call this old number that didn’t exist because I had tried it. The irony was this woman kept speaking to me in full English sentences, but then she would say I don’t speak English? She would say “Sir you have to call this number for help” “Sir nobody speaks English here not even my colleagues” “Sir we have no manager here to help you” I told her that her English was fine & that she was speaking to me in full English sentences.  I was pleading with her to help me.  I got my friend to call her & talk to her in Spanish, and she told my friend that she couldn’t book our seats & to wait till we got to the airport. She told my friend that all the seats were booked. The next morning when we arrived at Barcelona Airport we checked in at the Lufthansa counter. We told this agent what the woman on the phone told us about there being no seats available and he couldn’t understand why she would say that because he said there were many seats available. Lufthansa needs to take responsibility for the lack of service from their staff behind the scenes. "

I'm writing this out of frustration, we live in Germany we have Lufthansa credit card, the miles and more program.

I had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so Lufthansa flights. There seem to be barely any LH flights that leave and arrive on time. In the last week, I took five LH flights and every single one of them was delayed. At this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. So, we finally took off 40 mins late. I specifically booked a seat in the first row because I have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that LH changed my seat and I was bumped back a few rows. As there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more “important” than I which is not a good feeling. (I would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) So much about recognising loyalty which doesn’t seem to have a significant role in Lufthansa’s playbook anymore. Food portions were so small that I thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. Over the last years the food at LH got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. The food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). Being German myself, I do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but I just don’t see why people of cultural backgrounds other the German would eat this. I suppose the food in Business was not worth more than about 3 Euros. There is no free food or drink service in Economy at all, The only thing Lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). So, here’s the “verdict”: With Lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. There is no free food or drink service in Exonomy Class Loyalty recognition is non-existent. Food is terrible and comes in “appetiser” portions only. I can’t see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)"

IFE had a very good selection, although the quality oft the screen could have been better. The food was very good, both taste and presentation. Drink selection was great including Champagne, a great Spanish red wine and raspberry brandy. One negative aspect was the missing free WIFI for Business class passengers.

The on-line system won't recognize my booking code even though it shows ""verified"", and I receive error messages. I have made six calls to customer service with no service at all. I have been disconnected two times, and on other calls I am told that the ""system is down"", ""you have to do this on-line"", ""supervisors are unavailable to assist"", and ""due to the high call volume, I can't get you assistance"". The last call ended with the representative telling me to ""call back in 15 minutes"". I wish for this review to focus only on the customer service center.

I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline's customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem, we received no information about the status of our bags, and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully, a service agent who overheard our conversation, and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore, Lufthansa's reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100% of the toiletry items and 50% of the clothing, we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th, we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts, which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise, two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead, we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions. Although the flight attendants offered to compensate us for the damaged seat, they changed their minds three times,  For the high price of a business class ticket, I expected much better treatment and a more comfortable experience.

My family and I were so excited to visit Venice for the first time, and booked an April 1 departure flight from Hong Kong though Frankfurt with Lufthansa.  Firstly, they canceled my outbound flight just a few days before without automatically rebooking me on an equivalent flight (incredibly, they just removed the segment from my itinerary), with just a discrete email sent to me. I felt myself lucky that I checked my email a day before going to the airport and realized what had happened. As their on-line rebooking system was completely useless (ie. they had simply removed the cancel flight segment without a trace from my itinerary, and so the on-line system could not even find it to rebook.). After 30 minutes of frustration with their useless chatbot, I called into their customer service line, and then the next 90 minutes of pain really started. I tried both their local HK and German hot lines, with a reasonable wait each time, but each time a few minutes into the call, the line would simply cut off. This happened whenever they put me on hold, and sometimes at other random times also. After trying both mobile and land lines at my end, I realized this was probably Lufthansa's IT system issue which the agents seem obvious to. In the next calls, I had to beg the agent to call me back if the line dropped so that they could complete the rebooking transaction. None did for about 10 tries! The Asia-line call center was particularly horrible, as the agent was incredibly rude and evasive, trying to argue immediately that Lufthansa had no responsibility to handle the case as the original ticket as booked through an on-line agent (I booked through Booking.com, whom I had already call. They indicated the Airline was the only one who could make the booking change). Incredibly the agent spent about 3 minutes tried to find every opportunity to evade instead of just solving the problem, and eventually the line dropped (or perhaps he just hung up on me!). Incredible that Lufthansa hires people like this for customer service.  That night, after nearly 90 minutes of trying, I finally got someone on the German call center who was kind enough to call be back after the system dropped the call. She said she rebooked me on a KLM flight that departed half a day earlier and despite the horrible experience, I thought I was saved! Next day, a Friday, my family (4 of us) rushed to the airport to catch the new flight. We had to pull both of our kids out of school a few hours early, and I left work early as the new flight departed mid-day Friday, instead of the original we booked which was early AM Saturday, just after midnight. We didn't realized the horrible April Fools trick Lufthansa has played on us until we reached the KLM check in counter. With 2 hours before flight departure, the counter agent informed us that Lufthansa has incorrectly rebooked the flight with wrong ticket numbers and we could not get on the flight."

My two kids and I flew to Germany several months ago. When we arrived in Berlin, my suitcase was no where to be found. I stood in line for over an hour. When I finally reached the front, I was told the bags were normally located within a day. They promised they would “do what they could” and that I would be reimbursed for any expenses that were incurred. The documents they handed me stated the same. The next day: no bag. I continued to check the website, call and email. No response. The website for lost luggage just stated it was still missing. We left and stopped at several second hand stores to find cheap clothes and other necessities, including a small suitcase and toiletries. I thought I did pretty well and kept the cost under $500.00. EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER We were in Munich when I received an email notifying me the suitcase was in Berlin. The email had a phone number to call with any questions or concerns. No response to emails. Phone calls bounced through automated systems like a pinball. I selected every option throughout the entire system and never reached a live person. Two weeks later we arrived back in Berlin where we would stay for two more days before flying home. I went to the airport to finally retrieve the luggage. I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: “You can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receipt”. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information. Six weeks later, I received another email requesting my ticket information and address. I sent the information back again with the message about a third time After two more months I received a final email: “Thank you for your feedback We sincerely apologize for the unintentional delay in responding to you.

Entering the plane, there was no space at all to place a hand luggage in the cabin overhead bin. That was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items, jackets, etc. I informed a flight attendant about this, she apologetically told me ""I know but now it is difficult to fix this"", an attitude I respected although the problem was not fixed. A bit later, another flight attendant tried to ""help"" me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag. Then, I told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit. He just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage, claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg (which is a cheap lie according to the official website of Lufthansa) and everyone has done the same here. That is rudeness at a different level, I've never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically (1st time flying with Lufthansa though, maybe that's the problem here). He also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat, that sounded so ridiculous. All in all, instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort (without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight), the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft! I have NEVER seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights I've been present. To the contrary, all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting. I will certainly never use Lufthansa again, it was the first and last time I did and I would discourage anyone using this airline that does not care about customer service at all!"

It stayed here for another two hours due to weather conditions (which happens) what was not acceptable however, was not providing any food. By this point my children hadn't eaten since midday and it was now 9pm. It then finally arrived at Munich at 2230 and we disembarked at 2300. Told to head to the service desk to see what was next, especially since a lot of people including us had missed their connection flight. The queue was huge and the very helpful help desk closed at 0000 before most people could get any information. A tannoy announcement came over saying they could not provide any hotels, but people could either get a hotel and then claim it back or were welcome to stay at the airport, on the floor, and check on the flights at 0600 the next day. No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge! To make things worse it was outside in the snow, and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers, as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this, as previously mentioned, the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away, but that was a task for tomorrow. That morning I discovered that I had in fact been kicked off that re-booking. According to the app I had now reached my final destination and so the seats were now vacant and booked by someone else. I attempted to use the app, online portal, the live chat and calling up the help line number, none of these could help and told me I had to go the the service desk in the airport. I then spent from 0945 till 1205 in a queue to speak to one of the 5 people working in the service help centre (I was number 3538 and when I got there it was at 3342) there were 12 desks for attendants to work from, but Lufthansa decided that the queue trailing the length of the airport only justified half filling those positions. Finally I was told that it was a glitch in the system and that there was nothing they could do about it but would book me in for the following day. So me and my family had to spend another day in mid winter with no warm clothing. Luckily the there was no issues with the next flight, except that our laggage was temporarily missplaced. We did manage to recover it and headed out for our holiday thinking that the worse was behind us. This was just the outward journey. The I was informed on 4pm the day before the flight home. It had been cancelled! I spent 4 hours on hold to get in touch with the ever-so-helpful Lufthansa online chat number 372 in queue!

Instead of resorting to this option I decided to call and get rebooked to a United flight from a different city (Newark). I called the number provided in the cancellation of my flight email from Lufthansa, but the person I spoke with was a third-party agent and unfamiliar with their job. I had to give them step by step instructions on how to proceed - and their incompetence totally screwed us up on our return. The night before my flight I could not check in as our return tickets were not being recognized. I spent hours of time with a United customer service agent. The agent eventually booked our seats assignments, but when I reached the airport we could not check in! We then had to go to the counter and the agent there had to fix our tickets as my husband wasn't even listed as a passenger. She told us that this was Lufthansa's fault for not entering proper code data. If we hadn't had seat assignments we would have missed our flight. After flying both Lufthansa and United, I can say United is better. This is shocking to me as previously Lufthansa was far superior but their standards have drastically changed. The food is bad, the entertainment selection is mediocre, and worse the seats are horrible! The only positive is the staff was friendly.

First time I've flown with Lufthansa in many years and my first time flying in business class with them. The post-purchase experience is absolutely appalling. They are incredibly difficult to contact and incorrectly denying any compensation claims. They send you repeated 'copy-paste' responses that don't correspond at all to your submission, then stop replying altogether. There was no in-airport support at Istanbul, we were denied access to the business class lounges when they cancelled our flight (which was their fault) and offered absolutely no compensation or support. The planes were dated with poorly maintained interiors. Very friendly cabin crew though. I don't see myself flying again with them internationally any time soon."

It seems almost disingenuous after seeing the price of very basic amenities stack up to more then you would have paid for a more pricey ticket. All in flight services felt extremely low budget. Everything was hidden behind a pay wall. I payed 18 USD for their second tier “fast” in flight wifi that would not even suffice to write this review at the time of my flight. The in flight meals were about as basic and cheap as possible. My advice would be to take your chances with another airline. On the only positive note I can think of, the flight crew were very friendly."

Flying long-haul with them for the first time after the pandemic, how things have changed! It was the worst in flight experience. The hardest seats one can possibly imagine for an 11h flight. Terrible food, and in the smallest quantities, no snacks, no fruit for in between. And the entertainment console, I could not even imagine something this terrible can exist in 2023. It was touch screen but mostly an instrument of torture for your fingers, and the slowest thing one can imagine. Not too great of a selection either. Paid internet available. Obviously their safety record is great, and I am happy they got me to my destination safe and on time. But it would have been nice if they did it with a bit more comfort.

When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline. In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind “unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect” - this was well below “does not meet expectations”. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we’d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I’m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. We’re going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are. I can only hope they uphold THEIR side of the agreement and get us to our destination. If you as an airline or business cannot uphold your end of the agreement, and continuously fail to meet the agreement, then it is my opinion that refunds should be provided. I will NEVER fly this airline again and will be sharing this story broadly with my friends, family, and any acquaintance on my socials."

Despite both email and verbal confirmations of refunds, Lufthansa have yet to honour the refund payment. It is unacceptable that a refund would be confirmed and then not actually paid, particularly in the circumstance where I had booked another flight with Lufthansa in order to return from Munich following my original flight cancellation. I have now in effect paid twice for my family to fly home. What makes this all the more frustrating, is that despite completing numerous “Customer Feedback forms” on the Lufthansa website, no one is responding to my queries and if any response is received it is an automated one. I have attempted three times to speak with a customer services representative and on every occasion they state that the “refunds department” is dealing with the request. At no point have I been able to speak to the refunds department and at this stage I believe Lufthansa to not be honouring the refund and frustrating my ever attempt to receive clarity on the situation in an effort to deter me from pursuing further. It is easily the worst customer service experience I have had with an airline. Which is saying a lot given issues experienced during the pandemic. Truly disgraceful and very disappointing."

The little bag of goodies contained a couple of tiny tubes of moisturizer - no earplugs, no eye mask .

I very much dislike aisle seats as I detest other passengers or crew brushing past me. On boarding the aircraft I saw that 6A and 6C had been given to a couple travelling together. So I feel that Lufthansa discriminated against me as a solo traveller and gave my seat to others so that they could conveniently sit together, even though they clearly booked and / or chose their seats later than me. There was absolutely no consideration to me or my preferred seat selection. On arrival at Funchal Airport I was also informed that there is no lounge.

I ask Lufthansa to analyze my request for compensation, which was informed to me at the time of booking my hotel in Munich by the customer service representative, since I missed the flight to Brazil due to the company's fault, reimbursement of food expenses I had at the hotel, as a voucher of 9 euros per day did not allow me to have 2 meals a day and change of my flight from Munich to Frankfurt at no cost, as we already know that it will be impossible for me to arrive in Munich at 1 pm and leave for Frankfurt at 14:00.

Prior to travelling, I was worried after having read all the terrible reviews, but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. The shorter flight was perhaps a third full and the flight attendants were polite and professional. They gave us water and a little chocolate. which I thought fine for the flight time of 1h30. Boarding in Bristol is by walking to the plane, and disembarking by bus in Frankfurt, both seemed well organised and with no delays. Upon arrival, the walk through Frankfurt Airport from the bus gates to the Z gates was well-signed and with no need to go through security again. The flight between Frankfurt and Singapore was delayed by an hour. Being a 747 on a busy route, the flight was full but boarding was quite fast with their automatic gates. The seats in economy are smallish but fine for anyone under 6ft. The flight attendants were again polite, professional and had ready smiles. The IFE system had a wide choice of films but was somewhat slow to use, and the Wifi wasn't working on this flight. There was a choice of supper (vegetarian pasta or chicken teriyaki) along with wine, beer or soft drinks. Unlike Singapore Airlines, the crew didn't walk around with drink trays in the middle of the night, so the next meal/drink was a breakfast (cheese and sundried tomato sandwich, yoghurt and the little chocolate). All in all, Lufthansa got me from A to C (through B) in a relatively pleasant manner. It's not 5* like Singapore Airlines, but I would rate this trip was a generally positive 4*."

The employees are super rude and the don't give care for resolving your problem. The cabin crew was polite. I travelled from Boston to Sofia, Bulgaria via Munich. My first flight got delayed and I missed the connecting flight. All of this was Lufthansa's fault not mine. I had to stay at Munich airport for 4 hours straight in a line for the customer service desk so I can be rebooked. The people at the line were crying because we all have different final destinations, no one seemed to care. I was with my dog (Pomeranian) that travelled with me in the cabin. I tried to explain that because there is not a pet relief area I can't stay for hours and hours at the line - they didn't care. There were people with small children that explained the same thing - they didn't care. Finally after a horrific wait I was booked on another flight to Frankfurt and from there I had to go to Sofia. Surprise! The flight was delayed again. I was left with 10 minutes to board the other flight. I ran through the airport because they didn't offer transportation to the gate even though all the delays are their fault, and let me tell you that there were no severe weather conditions or any complications of that sort. Their disorganization and lack of communication led to this absolutely awful journey. Years back I travelled with Lufthansa and I can tell that they had top performance. Finally, after all I tried to email them for a partial refund because of all the issues they caused and they denied it. In conclusion, don't travel with them it is not worth your money and your time."

Normally I fly with OneWorld but thought I'd try out Lufthansa for this trip as the seats were a reasonable price. Booking was pretty seamless and easy. However it was downhill from there. There is little to no ground service help at the airports. It's mostly outsourced to companies who have little power to actually help you; useless when your flight is cancelled and you can't be rebooked for 3 days. Absolutely appalling lack of communication from on-ground and central customer service, with each customer service agent either not replying at all or contradicting their colleagues. Trying to claim for any kind of compensation has been a nightmare (despite assurance from the ground staff at the time) and I'm not holding out any hope.

We booked our flights based on price more than anything else, so we weren't expecting a great deal. Boarding was straightforward and not delayed. The A340 had a 2-4-2 configuration, and one of the crew had whispered to me ""the flight is empty, once we say boarding completed, grab yourself a row for sleeping""; unfortunately, the couple in front of me decided they would have a row each, so my wife and I had to settle for a pair of seats each. Compared to the Singapore A350, the Lufthansa plane was showing its age, though it was fairly clean and tidy, but the toilets in particular had seen better days. We were served dinner soon after departure, which was a hot meal, there wasn't anything else on offer, and anything between that and breakfast had to be purchased, which I did not expect from a full service carrier. That said, one of the cabin crew pointed this out and suggested I may need more than one beer for the 14 hour flight, so placed 2 spares in my seat pocket. The inflight entertainment system was OK, though the range wasn't as good as others, particularly on the music channels. Breakfast was very odd; it was a very large cheese roll - more like lunch than breakfast, with a thick lump of cheese and no pickle. Flight wise, this was the smoothest trip I have ever been on, and the landing was buttery smooth; it was though a culture shock when the aircraft parked a long distance from the terminal and we disembarked on to a bus - 70 passengers on an A340 all bunged on a single bus!"

After we finally landed in Cape Town 2.5 days late to our celebrations. I noticed that our flights back were cancelled again. I managed to rebook but after that checked every day to make sure we still had the flights to go back. Stressful and unnecessary! The flight back was on time and the older lady (she was the only one in business class that was pleasant!). The guys were extremely rude and one of them was more interested looking and playing with his moustache than providing service. The short flight from Frankfurt was pleasant and the staff lovely.

No different to BA. The cabin did look a bit tired and used, Cabin Crew were lovely and the catering was of decent quality if a bit miserable. On the return trip the crew were exceptionally nice especially the Purser. You could tell that this lady enjoyed her work. I was impressed with her friendliness and attentiveness.

On 27th it should be at Izmir's aiprort. We went to the Izmir's airport but they didn't help us from Lufthansa and told us that there is no information about the baggage and they will call us.

After a 12.5 hour journey from Singapore to Frankfurt, I arrived to Frankfurt only to get a message from Lufthansa saying my flight was cancelled. No other explanation or information given. Staff directed me to the Lufthansa service Center still refusing to give an explanation. There were over 120 people waiting in the line before me, all of whom had their flights delayed or cancelled from different countries. I waited over 4 hours in that line from 6pm to 10pm. When I finally got to the front, they told me the next flight to Madrid was the following day morning and was even put on the waitlist of that flight because it was so full. I was stuck in Frankfurt (-4deg Celsius) for the night with no additional clothes or my coat because they would not release my luggage. The next day by some luck, I got on the flight to Madrid which was at 10.15am. Due to delays, the flight left at 1pm. When I reached out to the Lufthansa for some sort of compensation for my troubles (I had missed a train in Madrid due to this) and frankly exhausting experience, the only compensation they gave was “we’re sorry”. I am absolutely put off and disgusted with the service & Lufthansa is one airline I will never fly with again."

What's happened to you, Lufthansa?? The most horrendous customer service, full of misleading information, and no result, in over 6 months! Needed to rebook parents' flights due to my father's medical emergency back in June... called a zillion times, phones constantly disconnecting, three times spoke to a different rep who rebooked for me, three times supposedly booking was confirmed, but then the booking code disappeared from the LH website... I'm beyond appalled!!! What a scam this airline has become!! I kept calling 1800 645 3880, the USA phone number. For weeks, even months, the voice message would say that the lines were busy and to call later. I finally got my call answered in November. I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. I tried the second time. The second rep assisted, I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. Five times in a row! This cannot be normal. At one point, I asked the rep whether they were having issues with phones, and she responded yes, but they are being worked on. But I called on other days, too, and it was the same. I got disconnected every time I got a rep on the phone. Is this a tactic by Lufthansa to keep customers away? Basically you can't get anything solved, since you get disconnected every time!! And I repeat, EVERY TIME!!! Over a span of two weeks, I called the US phone number about 10 times, and got disconnected every time, after I explained to the rep what I needed. So I called the German phone number +49 - 69 - 86 799 799, on December 5, 2022. The rep reviewed the files and offered to rebook my parents' tickets. We spend over an hour on the phone (and got a message from AT&T phone company that I just got charged $200 for the long distance call). The rep gives me a new booking code. She took my credit card number and said I would be charged $41.23 for tax, and $150 for rebooking, for either of my parents. I agreed to these terms. The rep gave me the new booking code. I checked on the website, and the code was on the LH booking site. Two days later I checked again, and the code was no longer there. I called +49 - 69 - 86 799 799 again. Asked a different rep why the code disappeared from the LH website. The rep checked, and said it was because those flights were no longer available (nobody let me know that! Imagine my parents going to the airport on the day of, and find no seats on the plane!). She offered to rebook to ‘available’ dates. Took my credit card information, told me that I would be charged $41.27 for either parent, the booking code would stay the same, and now we’re supposedly confirmed. I received an email from Lufthansa with confirmation. However, the email also said to “Please call back your Lufthansa Service Center”. I smelled a problem again! I called Lufthansa, spoke to a rep, who checked the booking, and she assured me that everything was in order. I also checked the website, and the booking showed. Two days later, IT DISAPPEARED AGAIN! I tried for the last time, on December 21, 2022. The LH rep said that the previous booking didn’t go for ticketing (no explanation provided!).

Waited 1 hour in the queue, just to be told that the registration can be made online. No Lufthansa personel on site for any explanation. I was surprised by the lack of sincerity from Lufthansa, the plane captain and crew, since they must have known the missing luggage before the departure but failed to share the information to the passengers.  If I was able to make the online registration in the plane, I could have left immediately the airport! Set aside the general difficulty around the increased air traffic, the lack of sincerity and transparency at Lufthansa has been a real shock; I will have no option but to consider alternatives.

The customer service desk at Heathrow T2 had a long line which was expected but after standing in line for 20 minutes all the customer service staff finished their shift, left the desk whilst a 50m long queue of people were waiting. After 2hrs no one had returned back to the desk to serve the customers. After someone asked we were sent to another customer service desk where again the lady behind the counter finished her shift without being replaced leaving customers again standing in queue with no one to help them. On arrival into Munich the following day (we had to pay for our own accomodation in London) 3 of our bags did not arrive. We placed a lost baggage claim at Munich airport but 4 days later we still do not have the luggage back or even an estimated date. I have made several phone calls trying to chase up where our baggage is (snowboard equipment so we have to hire equipment costing us approximately $2000 AUD) and no representative from Lufthansa is willing to assist us in prioritising our baggage to be located.

One nice touch is that on many routes a small bar of chocolate and an apple are offered after the meal. Our flight was a little late departing which was frustrating but understandable as the sub-zero temperatures across Europe were causing delays everywhere.

After waiting at the Florence airport for 7 hours, Lufthansa cancelled our flight out and claimed weather (not sure how it could have been weather since another flight going to the same place, Frankfurt, was allowed to take off). We were now stranded with no one to help us. We were told to go to the customer service desk where we initially checked in for the flight. The rep recommended that we travel to another airport and book a flight out on a different carrier. We did this at great expense to us. We have since asked Lufthansa to reimburse us for the Lufthansa flight that we never took because it was cancelled by Lufthansa. They refused. I never want to fly this airline again.

I have been up for over 36 hours at this point and my flight has been delayed multiple times. It was originally supposed to leave at 1040 am and now we are looking at 600pm. We are going to Chicago, and from there have a flight to Charlotte, NC before driving 3.5 hours home. This is on top of being told we will be provided a “meal” but being given only trail mix, some kind of chocolate cookie bar, water and juice. We were also loaded onto shuttle buses that had very few seats, we were packed in like sardines, and taken to the tarmac to board a new flight. We watched them load our luggage while we sat stationary on the tarmac with no explanation. Then they started unloading the luggage back off the plane and we began receiving texts that our flight was delayed again until 4pm them immediately received another text stating it was delayed until 6pm. My partner as significant rheumatological health problems and did not have access to a seat, which is a problem for her, and was in tears from standing stationary on a flat hard surface for so long. There was poor air circulation on the shuttle and the close proximity of everyone packed onto the shuttle quickly made it become suffocatingly hot.  We waited approximately 45 minutes on the shuttle in front of the plane before being told, with zero explanation, that we were being taken back to the gate we had just left.  We were then told that our gate was moved from z54 to B23, which is quiet the hike in the airport. This is on top of sleep deprivation and zero real food. I began researching Lufthansa customer rights and found that we are supposed to be provided with a meal voucher to be used at participating restaurants within the airport and that it is built into the bar code of the boarding pass. When we went to use it, the lady at the restaurant said it was something they honor and use but when she scanned the code, she said it hadn’t been activated by the airline yet. When we came back to the counter to see about having it activated, we were told they couldn’t activate it and a manager had to. It is now 408pm local time.  I understand that delays happen but the overall lack of communication and lack of customer service has been appalling.

I have flown Lufthansa for decades, (because I primarily fly on United, and being the Star Alliance partner, inevitably I would be on Lufthansa in the European portion). This month was the first time I traveled outside of the U.S. since the pandemic. I had heard that Lufthansa has completely fallen off the cliff in terms of service, reliability and even general operational adequacy, but I thought, a short 2 hr flight RT between Frankfurt and Madrid, how bad can that get? Their seats booking system is broken, and while we had paid for premium seats over and over again (and promised previous overcharged payments would be refunded, I don't expect to see that refund), we essentially had no premium seat assignments up to the day of departure. Their ground crew was rude and hostile, (e.g. just did not answer my questions, rolled their eyes and smirked with agents next to them, etc.), and the flight crew basically was not present throughout the flight. No service whatsoever on the flight (no snacks, no drinks, I didn't know this is a discount budget airline?). Mobile boarding pass could not be issued at time of check in, I had to line up at airport, at which point, the agent harassed me by insisting on weighing my carryon (they did not insist on doing that for my husband who is White), and said my carryon was 1 kg over, so I had to check it.

Lufthansa's current fleet to and from Bombay is either the aging A340 or the aging B747-400 aircraft. Both are well past their prime and so is the Business Class seating configuration which is 2-2-2 with no direct aisle access for the passenger by the window. The dated seat design is not in the same class as those offered by rivals such as Qatar, ANA, Singapore Airlines and so on. Where Lufthansa shines is the inflight service which is top notch. The flight attendants are warm and efficient. Currently it is not worth paying for Lufthansa Business Class. The only reason I stick with this airline if the suitability of routing for my needs."

However unlike in London on departure to Munich this was not followed up with mandatory removal of hand luggage by staff. This is all free of charge. As the staff did not force passengers to enter baggage into the hold this created an uneasy attitude towards luggage already in place in overhead storage - this created animosity within the plane and aggressive behaviour. There were numerous bags far too big and heavy into the above lockers. I find this level of incompetence astounding as the first journey was nothing like the incompetence we’ve received on return.

From Frankfurt I had a 1 hour - 40 minute stop over to reach my connecting flight to HK. An hour before the flight was due to depart I received an email advising me that my Geneva tō Frankfurt flight was going to be 15 minutes late. 30 minutes later, I received another email advising that the flight would now be an hour delayed. A Lufthansa representative eventually advised the delay due to a ‘technical’ problem, and that ground staff would at Frankfurt would be on hand to help all passengers with late or missed connecting flights. While waiting for our plane to land in Geneva we were told the replacement plane was smaller than the original intended plane, as such, our hand carry luggage would have to be surrendered upon boarding, This created even more delays. 40 minutes into the flight, the pilot announced that due to bad weather, the flight would be now diverted to Nuremberg. At the Nuremberg tarmac, we were given little information. Hours later we were told we would be bussed to Frankfurt, however we were waiting for a bus to arrive, and also, there were no ground crew to help disembark the luggage. Later, we were told to collect our luggage and wait for the bus. No specific area was designated. Eventually an airport representative came out and advised the bus would be arriving in 10 minutes The bus ride would take approximately 2 and a half hours. During this entire 6-7 hour Geneva to Frankfurt ordeal, passengers were not fed nor given time to use the bathroom. During the bus ride I received emails from Lufthansa advising me they had, without consulting me, rebooked the remainder of my trip home. This rebooking meant an entirely different route, and it would also mean I would arrive back in New Zealand a whole day later than I had intended. At Frankfurt we disembarked at a bus stop. No Lufthansa representative was there to greet or advise us. The bus driver simply drive away with no instructions. A majority of the passengers stood around lost and confused. Using my phone Google maps, I began walking terminal 1 at Frankfurt airport. At the terminal, we discovered it largely deserted. Not surprisingly as it was well after midnight. Most check-in counters were closed. Eventually we found some staff who handed every passenger vouchers for 1 night stay at a hotel and two taxi vouchers and told us we had to sort out our problems in the morning. Weather problems aside, if there were no technical problem with Lufthansa's plane to begin with, we would have landed in Frankfurt on schedule and avoided the airport closure due to ‘bad weather’ and I would have made my flight to Hong Kong. Even after the bad weather and plane diversion issue, the lack of support and help from Lufthansa made the bad experience worse. There was no attempt by Lufthansa to help or guide us from Nuremberg to Frankfurt, and there was no help at all once we arrived at Frankfurt. I have since contact Lufthansa Customer Relations, to date my attempts to contact them have been ignored. "

The best they could do was to give me some thick blanket to put under. That made it better, but still not comfortable. The food was the worst I even had on a long flight. First meal was vegetarian ravioli and there was no other choice. When I commented that I am not vegetarian, the flight attendant was very rude, stating that she can only give me what she had.

We have evidence documenting the numerous calls lasting over 50 hours in total, as well as all the emails/screenshots of bookings from the website documenting the booking changes, as well as the flight cancellations that were made without our knowledge and were not informed of until checking ourselves. At this time, despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, the itineraries are missing components of the journey as originally booked ie. the last leg of the trip from DEL - AMD for record locators #1 & 2. The customer service agents have not been able to resolve this and have pretty much said there is nothing they can do in terms of ensuring we have confirmed flights for the entire trip as planned and have left us hanging, without answers, and in a panic as our travel date approaches. I also intend to submit a compensation request as advised by an agent in order to be compensated for the price paid for the flights at the time of booking as well as the additional fare difference to book on ticket now with a different carrier, and making the same request to management if they are unable to resolve our problem internally, by booking us on appropriate Lufthansa/Partner flights as booked and paid for."

Also in the outbound leg, the B748 was changed last minute to a B744, which was (at least for me) pretty nice because I had never flown in one. That said, my seat was not changed and I got to still sit in the upper deck. Many people were not so fortunate and this caused quite a bit of a commotion on ground."

Schedule changes feel very much the norm in today's travel however, I would have hoped the passenger log for my flight would have been correct. Shortly after take off the lead member of the cabin crew took his time to introduce himself to some of the passengers with some polite chat. At this point it became apparent, despite checking in 12 hrs earlier the passenger log had no idea who I was. Asked if I was someone I wasn't, an accusing ""have you changed seats"" was delivered followed by the non reassuring ""oh, no don't worry"" and a clear tone of 'your not at a high enough loyalty member to warrant my time' was delivered in a closing remark. It should be easy for the cabin crew to tell the truth, so when during the second meal service I was informed that the first option was no longer available I was surprised to see the opposite row still able to order and receive, with the polite question asking if option 1 was actually available my original meal choice was found. I can't help thinking Lufthansa have stripped all customer service out of their operation, several attempts to contact the team before the flight were ignored, the only engagement came when they cancelled a section of the journey and asked me to call them, nice touch that their automatic email pretends they have tried to contact me. A small connection flight cancellation was apparently enough to confuse the booking system and the many people in the call centre.  It took six hours of my time reviewing the Lufthansa schedule and and their ticketing availability to find a route that the 'system' would allow. To rub salt into the wound, at HND I was approached by an agent for Lufthansa and asked if I would like to change flights,  for one of the routes I had been denied and that had always shown availability. This is not helpful one hour out when I had arranged business calls around the terrible schedule Lufthansa and landed me with."

I made a change to my business class air ticket on phone with a Lufthansa representative and got his confirmation and paid him online. The change happened 10 days before the departure. On the day of departure, the counter person told me the Lufthansa had done something wrong and I have to pay $1,700 in order to take the flight. I was shocked and so upset, it took over an hour to have someone on the phone to admit that the problem has been created from their side. However, this was 30 mins before the departure so I barely made it to the flight. I arrived in Istanbul on Oct 12th at 5pm, and I have not yet received my luggage, and it’s been 52 hours since I arrived. I’m so disgusted with the level of unprofessionalism that Lufthansa has demonstrated from booking, online services, checking in, airplane, their cabin service and low quality and quantity of food.

Furthermore, the flight was surprisingly pleasant and comfortable, and good service was provided, despite being fully booked. Lufthansa might not be as fancy as Qatar or Singapore, but both dinner and breakfast were decent and drinks were filled up frequently. While the seating arrangement in 2-2-2 is not the latest standard for business class, I found the seat comfortable enough for 11 hours. On these really long flights, Lufthansa now provides extra padding for the seat to sleep on and a sleeping shirt. The only drawback is the entertainment program, there used to be a better selection of movies, and the music selection is really poor, obviously that's the field to cut costs now.

She selected seats in a row that was about halfway between the mid and rear toilet areas. (Around row 40) When we arrived at the departure lounge at Munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. The Lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in Business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. The clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. The suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. After some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. When we got on board, I got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that I had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. I hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. When I got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what I thought was mine or my wife's seat. A short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. Some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. The seats my wife and I endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. The seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. There was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. We noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to Singapore. Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. We had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. So, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. We received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. My wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. When we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat. The parents did their best but the crying and continuous getting up and down to silence the baby made sleep impossible for anyone nearby. Cabin staff were noticeably absent in assisting the parents.

I was then rebooked for another flight 6 hours later from Munich to Singapore with a 7 hour layover to Seoul. The reason I booked Lufthansa in the first place was to get the direct flight from Europe. But apparently there was not even one seat available on the direct route the day after. I could have stayed at an airport hotel and Lufthansa could have at least guaranteed me a somewhat comfortable sleep as compensation for their delay, but instead I get to spend the night on my way to Singapore and a day at the airport, already tired from the long extra wait, not even to mention missing my meetings in Seoul that I had planned. When I booked my original ticket I had paid extra for window seats, but as the window seats were already fully booked I got an aisle seat and when I asked if I could at least be upgraded for the inconvenience I was told that it would be on my own expense. As I will be almost 24 hours delayed I thought as it states on the Lufthansa website, that I would get the necessary care during the redirecting, but all I got was a 15 euro voucher (which had to be spent all at once) in one of the airport restaurants. Sadly most meals start at 20 euros so it should rather be called a modest meal contribution instead. Very sad to have around 24 hours longer to spend in airport transfer with a 15 euro “meal” voucher, aisle seats despite having already paid for window seats and a service level below minimum.

We flew it coming here because my husband is European and he believed Lufthansa was a good airline. We first took it from SFO and the first problem was they made us pay for luggage even though I showed the agent that our ticket included 1 checked luggage. I always pay for luggage beforehand because it’s a lot cheaper than what they make you pay at the airport. He made us pay $75 anyways. This rubbed me the wrong way but I went on with the vacation. Of course my husband wanted to use them going back to SFO so we did. First, they left late so the plane was delayed and we missed our connection. We tried to run and make it but were held up in Germany because the lady was upset that she couldn’t find a stamp in my passport even though I kept telling her I have a residency card for Italy so I don't get a stamp. We missed our connection and then had to deal with customer service from hell at Lufthansa. They guy was unbelievably rude. I first asked him if there was another, earlier flight he could put us on so that we wouldn’t have to sit at the airport for like 5 hours. He said no. I asked him if there was a customer service centre and I guess that made him mad because from there he became rude. He told us that we didn’t even pay that much for our ticket and it wasn’t ‘that bad’ and I should be fine with it because it’s not like I’ve never had a delayed flight before. He continued on being rude. I think customer service is definitely the wrong profession for him. I have never ever had to deal with someone like him and I’ve been flying all over the world since I was a teenager. We missed our connection because of their mistakes and instead of being empathetic and kind, he was the opposite. Absolutely despicable. I will never ever fly this airline again.

I thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in Munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of Star Alliance. First, the positives. They automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in Frankfurt. Also our baggage did not get lost. So they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. So, what went wrong? Inconveniently, there was not a single member of Lufthansa staff available at the airport in Munich. Thankfully we had downloaded the Lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. Customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or SMS communication. EU passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. However, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". We took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to Frankfurt departed. Having to spend a night in Munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. The food that Lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. Crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into Munich. All the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. Lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. The designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. There were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. Perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of Lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. The next morning we boarded our new flight to Frankfurt at 6am. On arrival, I searched out the Lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. Most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of Lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. They did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for Muscat, so that meant spending an extra €17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. No further dramas onward to Muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. It has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from Lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law. The only communication we've had was an email telling us to confirm our new itinerary (sent 2 days AFTER we arrived) and an automated email in response to my complaint, which asked me to submit my flight details (which I had already done 3 times by this point). This experience is in stark contrast to a previous experience with KLM, travelling to Dubai via Amsterdam, where we were given the compensation in cash at the service desk, and there was a driver waiting outside to take us to a hotel for the night.

When you’re paying for business class, you really should get an amenity kit. Even if it’s not the best one in the world. The minimal amount they’re saving, that’s really shameful. Also, they didn’t offer us bottled water until we got off the plane. And the flight that was seven hours to eight hours long, they really should give you a bottle of water if you’re going to take a nap so you can take sips as you need it. One more thing, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working at all. I definitely would not fly Lufthansa for a transatlantic flight again."

The first leg from Brussels to Frankfurt was Okay, I do not remember anything extraordinary about it, it was a short 40 minute flight in a regular plane with a regular very-short-haul experience. The second leg from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv was rather odd. We had a connection of 2.5 hours. When we landed in Frankfurt on time the screens showed us the flight was already boarding, which we found to be very weird. We sprinted to the gate, through connection security and passport control, and were devastated to discover that apparently, Israel has special travel regulations that make all flights landing to Israel go through a special process. Our gate was separated from all other gates, it had extra security and when we passed it we saw there is no plane even at the gate. So after security we were essentially locked in a gate that had only one super-over-priced store selling basic literature and food. We waited for 90 minutes until boarding started. When we sat in the plane the pilot announced that our plane ""has the wrong wheels"" and that it would take us 3 hours to replace all the wheels of the aircraft. All passengers were angry. After 40 minutes the captain announced that we will be brought back to the gate, and transferred to a different aircraft. After an hour buses were organized to the new airplane, same model, A321. Once we arrived there were a few dramas involving passengers that were mad that because the configuration was a bit different in the new plane, couldn't seat next to their loved ones. After an intervention of the German police we took off. The crew was excellent, especially A Stadelmann, who although being very tired as we did, did her best and gave an excellent service. At turbulence when I panicked she noticed and calmed me, we had a quick chat and all in all she was very welcoming, using words like ""dear"" to make me feel warm and welcome aboard the plane. The flight was regular, there was no entertainment, and complimentary soft drinks and disgusting sandwiches were given. We landed in a delay of almost three hours, the flight after the drama went perfectly fine. Lufthansa should check her planes twice before almost letting passengers fly in them! I would fly Lufthansa again to make my up my opinion about them fairly."

Secondly, the quality of the airplanes left a lot to be desired: they were creaky, cramped, the seats had minimal cushioning, and they lacked proper ventilation. The plane on the international leg of return trip was so unbearably hot, we couldn't sleep or get comfortable at all. Thirdly, the quality of the food was horrible - you were given only one option vegetarian pasta for dinner and a dry, horrible tasting vegetarian sandwich for the other.

Not enough? On this very flight, front economy passengers who have paid + US$30,00 for a broader seat, were offered a choice of the main course and free complimentary spirits, all this smell moving backwards, there was no curtain separation.

You should change the name because you bring shame to the company I know. I have been a Lufthansa customer for over 30 years. Mainly I fly from the USA to Europe and around Europe. However, the last trip was a nightmare. I had booked a return flight to the USA from Katowice Via Frankfurt to Boston. I made the reservation 6 months before departure. 8 days before departure, I received an email informing me that my scheduled flight LH1363 from Katowice to Frankurt was canceled, no reason was given, and no alternative flight was offered either. I called Lufthansa USA asking what options could be offered to us, I got a reply with no alternative options for us! I checked the connection from Krakow to Frankfurt on a regular Lufthansa website and guess what? There was a flight from Krakow to Frankfurt LH 1371 on the same day and time as my canceled flight from Katowice. I called Lufthansa USA again with a request to change the canceled flight from Katowice to the one from Krakow. A sleepy lady (probably from India because she spoke English poorly) stated that there is no such flight! And he can offer us a flight from Katowice To Berlin from Berlin to Munich and from Munich to Frankfurt. Of course, I interrupted the conversation because my patience was exhausted. On the Lufthansa website I have easily booked a flight from Krakow to Frankfurt LH1371 (July 22.2022). Of course I had to pay for this flight separately as no one at Lufhansa wanted to help us and rebook for this flight. Let me add here that the distance between Katowice and Krakow airports is less than 63 miles. And for the best now, Lufhansa is refusing to reimburse the full costs of the flight they have canceled. From the amount I paid $ 1135, they returned $ 86.90 so far! After 30 years of traveling with Lufthansa, it's time to say goodbye to them. "

Then in the middle of her call, she told me that I will travel today on my flight, then she continued to complete her phone call to do all the required steps. She took my two bags to weigh them and asked if I can pay for the second page. I paid and then she gave me all the boarding passes for my 2 trips. I would like to thank her for her patience and time. She told me from the beginning that, she would never ever start by telling any traveler that he will not travel today unless she tried her best in every case. I asked her for her full name as I really would like to thank this smart, hard-working woman. Thank you again and please Lufthansa take my feedback seriously as she made me love to travel with you again after I decided to be my last trip with you.

Price was outrageous, around 6,700 EURO / person, so 21,000 EUR altogether. Service for that price was completely inadequate. Seating: I'm tall but not super tall (6 ft 5''). Did not fit while sleeping into the narrow seat on the A330-300 Business Class, thus couldn't sleep at all. Used to fly a lot between NYC and FRA on the 747-800 (Business Class). That is a completely different size of seat, so it feels like they are trying to fit more seats into Business Class by shrinking the comfort.  Not enough Meals: We were 3 persons on that flight, each person getting their menu at the beginning of the flight. Turns out, they couldn't serve us what we wanted as they did not have enough meals on board. Compare that against the ticket price of 6,700 EURO per person. Also cabin service overall was mediocre ... this is a 9 h 30 min flight and there was close to zero service between meals. You had to actively get up and ask for anything you wanted. Can understand if you try to minimize disturbing sleep of the passengers, but no service is not the answer to that. Lastly, I have gold status (Senator) at LH and was asking at check in if they could connect that flight with my miles account which they said they did ('Are you sure?' Yes!). Turns out, this is not the case. Other than that, check in was nice and helpful. So overall after that experience in combination with that premium price, I would say LH are on the way to serve the market with premium marketing and price, but mediocre performance. Will prevent flying with them again on long haul trips, especially if I see an A330-300 is servicing the trip."

We had booked our flights 2 months in advance and there was no option to add a pet to our booking online. Customer service agents and supervisors were extremely unhelpful.

After many hours struggling with Lufthansa customer service and their useless chat-bot I finally managed to rearrange my flights for Saturday, arriving in Ljubljana at lunchtime.

More hours on hold for LH customer services, including one memorable 2.5hr hold. Finally the managed to find flights for me on Saturday evening to Frankfurt arriving at 11pm and then onto Ljubljana at 9.00am the next day getting me at lunchtime. This meant that I would now miss two days. I got the flight at LHR, checking in two piece of hold baggage. I arrived at FRA and went to the hotel desk only to be told that the hotel I had been allocated was on the other side of Frankfurt. When I finally got there it turned out LH had sent lots of people there and the poor hotel staff were having difficulty checking so many people in near midnight. By the time I checked in it was midnight and the bar and the only food facility had closed. The next morning I returned to FRA to continue my flight. When I got on board I asked the flight attendant if she could check that my luggage had been loaded as there had been such a long delay between flights. She told me that the Load Master assured her it was. When I finally arrived in Ljubljana there was no sign of my luggage. I filled in the Property Irregularity Report and left for my hotel in Ljubljana. This was the Sunday and my luggage arrived on Wednesday evening at 11pm!

A company training their ground staff to use cheap flirty tactics on valuable passengers. To me Lufthansa needs a change in managing and training their staff. However the inflight service was relatively ok and the seats were comfortable. The inflight service was ok as the fight attendants had done a good enough job to comfort their passengers. The staff in Frankfurt were ok but not overly impressive. The flight coming back was delayed but it was ok. Overall, I rate the service in Vancouver was unacceptable as it would be 2/10 but inflight was ok 8/10 and Frankfurt staff was 7/10. Good enough for my trip back. Lufthansa really need to upgrade and improve their service in Vancouver. I will be travelling a lot for my new career and I will be an important part of the world’s success going forward.

The staff at the check in counter were unable to help me and I was again told to line up at the rebooking counter. There, after another 4-5 hour wait, I was told that my entire booking had been canceled by the computer system because it had considered me missing my initial connecting flights as a “no show”. In addition to canceling my booking the computer system had also surrendered the seats I had been rebooked on and these were now unavailable. I was then told that Lufthansa was unable to rebook me on a Lufthansa or star alliance flight for a period of at least 4-5 days.

Unbeknownst to us, two of our family members had been bumped and were listed under an alternate confirmation number. Therefore, we had to rebook for the day after we should have flown. We are at a loss why they cancelled two of our seats in our original itinerary and why we were not informed. Things got worse as the plane was delayed leaving Venice the next day and we had to run to our connecting flight in Frankfurt. We would have been too late but luckily the flight from Frankfurt had been delayed an hour so we made it. However, our baggage was left behind. Not sure just how many people were in the same boat but when the luggage carousel stopped at Dulles, there were at least 30-40 people still waiting for their bags. Here we are, 18 days later, and only one of our four suitcases has made it home. Who knows where the rest are because Lufthansa doesn’t – despite there being luggage tags on each case. Customer support has been less than helpful during this time and we are still waiting for the many invoices we have submitted for replacement items to be paid. We understand staffing resource limitations is probably contributing to lack of response regarding our baggage, but when Lufthansa asks you if you’d like to check in your carry-on bags for free, say no!"

The first time, I received an email that my flight was cancelled, they didn't even rebook me and I had to call the hotline to rebook the ticket. I was in queue for a few hours and when it was my turn the customer agent was not very friendly. However, my new flight details were never sent to my email. I added on an extra baggage for my return flight but I was only allowed one check in baggage for the new flight. Because I didn't want to waste money on roaming calls, I used the live chat option on their website, of which they are even more unresponsive and I had to retry several times and wait a few hours before I got to chat with a live agent. This time, I rebooked to another (less ideal) flight but I didn't have a choice as I had to find my way home somehow. When it was less than 2 weeks away from my return flight, I got notified again that my flight got cancelled, they said that they were unable to rebook me on a flight anytime for the whole of July to the first few days of August. When I searched on the Lufthansa website to try and book a one way flight back home, I saw that they clearly had multiple flights back home with plenty of seats still available. However, the agent said that those flights were not accessible for me to rebook. At this point it was clear that Lufthansa did not respect me at all. Not only did they cancel my original flight back home, they did not allow me to rebook on similar flights, instead asking me to delay my flight back home by at least 2 weeks. I was so done with them and asked if they had an email which I can complain to, but there was none. in the end, I asked for refund (which I have still yet to receive) and booked a one way flight with another airline.

After the delay, I was flown by Lufthansa to Munich and landed just before midnight. Because the flight was delayed I missed my connecting flight. Upon our plane landing in Munich, the pilot and flight attendant staff instructed us that there are no more flights until tomorrow and to go straight to the Lufthansa service desk to assist us due to our circumstances and missing connections. Once we exited the plane and got into the airport, the Lufthansa Munich service desk immediately made an intercom announcement stating that they are closing their service desk (regardless of a plane full of people just arriving off of a Lufthansa flight with nowhere to go) and told us that there are no hotel rooms available for us, no transportation, no meals and to sleep in the airport. They were very rude to us and would not answer any questions we had.  The service desk staff told us that they will not give us any new boarding passes or more information on backup plans, etc until 0600 the next morning. Over a hundred of us were left stranded after midnight in horrible conditions.  The only option I had at that point was to find a taxi to get me home. Bottom line: I refuse to be treated like an ill poverty-stricken, neglected and mistreated animal by Lufthansa. I understand that delays and cancellations can happen, however the treatment we received by the Lufthansa service desk staff in Munich was inhumane."

I have purchased the tickets Vilnius - Frankfurt-am-Main - Halifax with an 8 hours stop at Frankfurt Airport aiming to meet up with friends there and travel further to Canada. Though I checked-in 24 hours before departure it turned out that the flight LH889 was overbooked and app. 20 passengers incl. me were left behind. The airport personnel first asked us to proceed to the gate and wait until departure probably hoping (!) that some places will reveal themselves. But the miracle was not there and 20 unhappy passengers were asked to go to the airport workers to rebook their flights. After 1.5 hour waiting, fortunately, a Vilnius airport employee found a solution for me and managed to rebook the flight to Frankfurt via Amsterdam. So I had to stop at one more airport and spent in the air 2.5 + 1.5 hours (Vilnius - Amsterdam - Frankfurt / Main) instead of around 1 hour 10 min (Vilnius - Frankfurt/Main). I was acceptable as long as I was on time for my connecting flight to Halifax. But the next ""surprise"" was waiting for me in Halifax. My luggage did not arrive. I immediately filed a report at the airport and waited patiently a week as it was agreed with the lost&found service. Since then I regularly write complaints and emails to airports and Lufthansa and receive no feedback at all! Nobody answers the phone either. On top of all these circumstances I had to cancel my fully refundable return ticket due to personal reasons and was shocked by the refunded 80 USD instead of 611 USD. The bad part is that you do not received the responses on your emails or cannot reach Lufthansa workers on phone.

It also took us more than 10 tries and sometimes over an hour on hold to get a hold of somebody and then they would transfer you and have to hold again for an hour. The worst service ever.

Flew CRJ 900 from Basel to Frankfurt. Seated in front of exit row. No window and no recline seat. Good thing it was only a 1 hour flight. Frankfurt Airport was horrid. Bussed us from remote pad to A terminal. Then had to walk 3/4 mile through A to C terminal, but required to exit secure zone when left terminal A. There was two separate B terminal security lines which were at least 200 yards long. Figured lots of people would miss flights in that terminal The line for C terminal security took around 45 minutes. Although we had a connection time of 1.5 hours we barely made it through security to the C15 gate in time. When going through the boarding ticket scan I was told I had to pay for baggage which I had already paid on check in at Basel. Gate agent had no record of us paying for baggage which would have cost us another $100. I finally reasoned with gate agent that we had already checked bags in Basel and paid the fee in Basel so they finally waived the extra baggage fee. we boarded the plane exhausted and dehydrated from the walk. After walking as fast as we could From A to C, we did not have time to purchase any water because it would be discarded at security in C terminal. we were thinking we would get a bottle of water on the plane. Sat on ground after boarding for another 1/2 hour. No beverage service for at least 30 minutes after take off. No bottle of water, only a half full 6 oz plastic cup. And no ice. Servers skipped us twice during flight and only offered drink service 30 minutes after takeoff, during the meal two hours into flight and two additional times before the ""snack"" during the 11 hour flight. The snack before landing was two pieces of bread and a slice of white cheese. I had to ask the servers for some water twice after being skipped. Seats and legroom seemed smaller than those on Delta. Delta has 4 times as many entertainment selections. Arrived in Salt Lake City feeling dehydrated the entire flight. Overall a truly miserable flight experience.

In fact - the entire Lufthansa experience was terrible. This starting on their website - in which I wrote a note querying some assistances required. Despite being promised an answer within 2 days, Lufthansa never bothered to acknowledge nor respond! On to the flights, the seating was pretty much the same as economy. And there appeared to be very few toilets on the plane, with access to all and sundry. The food was very poor. The drinks service was abysmal, one drink allowed  and that was it! No doubt Lufthansa on a cost saving program? Found the air hostesses to be less than helpful- and in some instances even rude. Lufthansa premium Economy is sold at a 50% premium to the normal Economy. This is in our opinion an absolute rip off. We most certainly will NOT be flying Lufthansa again.

Already checked- in, bag drop took 1.5 hours, security another 1 hour, and there is the random boarding pass checkpoint that took half and hour, then I’m late for my flight! I was still 10 mins before take off by the time I reached the gate. But there is no plane there because gate has changed and passengers are supposed to get on a bus and get to a different gate. The agent at the gate told me to go to customer service. I waited in line for 1.5 hours to see one. And she told me there is nothing she can do and she keeps pointing finger to the Frankfurt airport, to United airline (the airline that I get the ticket for a flight operate by Lufthansa), and to me! She did nothing but pointing finger. My resolution was calling United and United put me on their own flight tomorrow. And I’m still out of my own pocket for the hotel because United is not the cause for the delay. Then, I need to retrieve my checked bag and the Lufthansa agent told me to go to bag desk. When I reached Lufthansa bag desk they told me to go back up and talk to the check in counter. And the check in counter told me to go to the customer service center. The Lufthansa customer service center were full of people, then a Lufthansa agent came out and tried to talk people away. She closed the customer service center door and gave everyone a quick answer to the question. My question for her was where’s my checked bag since I’m now leaving tomorrow with another airline. She said Lufthansa has a system and the bag follows wherever I go. So I told her I am flying with another airline and how does that connect with the system of another airline. She said the system can do that but that’s definitely a lie because I have an United agent on the line when everything happens and she told me she cannot see the bag on United system. So the Lufthansa agent just shut the door, lie to people to their faces and intimidate you to make you walk away. I went to the check in Lufthansa counter again and ask where’s my luggage. This time the agent ask how come my luggage is not with me so I told her the whole story again and her comment was what happened to my us on TV everyday and it’s just me being late so I make all these excuses up. In the end, she did told me I need to go to the United counter to have my bag transfer to the United system. I cannot understand how can everyone from Lufthansa so unhelpful and incompetent. And they worst part is they lie so that you walk away and said something untrue to make you feel bad and think they are not the problem. When there is such a long wait at the airport, they need to send out notifications to remind people to come earlier than 3.5 hours, which is already a lot and more than expected. They did absolutely nothing to help but lies, pointing fingers, pushing you around. I would rather not go to the places Lufthansa fly to than taking Lufthansa again. "

Walked the mile long from arrival to departing gate at z62 and asked an agent if I was at right gate and flight, she said yes. I asked I may be late if checking started, she said sit down you are here check in will start an hour later. After some time I asked again only to be told that flight departed and directing me to service center to be rebooked for next flight either 12pm or 2pm flight. This was another mile long walk. Ran to the service center only to find nearly 100 frustrating pax. Tired to get attention of customers service agent to explain situation only to be told join the queue. I begged that I will miss the next flights if I join but she hurriedly said to just join the line. By the time it was my turn, all flights to Houston have departed and was told have to spend a night in Frankfurt until next day flight. Thinking if I got delayed m, then my baggages will make it on time with me right, that was not the case. Came home empty handed, baggage left behind in Frankfurt or Brussels. Followed up with calls and no one can help. When you are lucky to get your call answered, the best bet if you will be told to call another number. Tried their Houston lost and found office and it took hours to get a call back. When I got a call back, I was told by the agent that I was talking to a supervisor who can help me but she too failed to call back to verify if my baggage arrived or not on the 7/8/22 flights. She said she was going to send a request to see if they can expedite the search which I am highly pessimistic she will do.

When it was my turn the Lufthansa staff rebooked me a flight from Frankfurt to Montreal then to Toronto and this flight was at 2:10 in the next day. So I had to wait in Frankfurt for 20h for my next flight. The Lufthansa staff gave me voucher for food but told me that most of the restaurants are already closed because the time was close to 10:00 pm. Moreover he told me that he cannot book me a room at my cloud hotel in Frankfurt because the hotel has no rooms left for Lufthansa.

No problem, so we landed in Frankfurt and we got our baby stroller for the 5 hours of transit time for our baby. We then check-in the flight from Frankfurt to Poznan in Poland but at the gate they asked us to handover our baby stroller and saying that it it will be handle back to us as soon as we arrived in Poland at the exit of the flight. We didn't received any stroller and went directly to baggage claim to file a complain. We got a claim number and went to our hotel. We have been waiting for 5 days and no one contacted us, since we arrived we are trying to contact Lufthansa in Poznan Airport and the luggage claim department but no one answer. It is ridiculous and not acceptable. We will purchase another baby stroller but will keep Lufthansa responsible of this.

The seat was great to spend time in that long and the noise of the aircraft is much lower and therefore I enjoyed the journey very much. Staff attitude was ok. I was little surprised that have to pay for spirits, but I can understand this due to the current economic climate in the world. Mainly because i know that I paid far little money for the tickets then others. The main negative was the food. Please make sure that you eat well before travelling, because what you will get inside the plane is absolutely horrible.

I do not recommend this airline, they are very irresponsible And they have no regard for the frustration of their customers."

We were given a sheet of paper (written in German) by one of the rudest women I have ever met. The number on the sheet of paper did not work and the rest of the paper was pretty useless. Lufthansa would send periodic emails about our luggage over the next few days with conflicting information. We had someone in the states, someone on the ship and my husband and I continually trying to contact them, to actually talk to a person, to no avail. After several hours on hold, the cruise representative was able to talk with someone one time, but they were no help - they just passed the responsibility on to someone else. And then, one day, Lufthansa apparently just gave up - no more emails. We had to hire someone in Greece to locate and find our luggage. We were without it the entire trip - 10 days. I have tried repeatedly over the last month to contact them and to file a claim, but again, absolutely zero contact except for one automated email response. "

I had no issues on my flight to Switzerland, the food was decent (as far as airplane food goes) and I was fairly comfortable (as far as the seating goes). I checked in no problem and well you got me to my point of destination with relative ease, my my my, how that has changed. This airline has made my life living hell in just 24 hours. They have screwed me not once, not twice, but about a million times over. Let's break it down. I am going to start with their website. The website is absolutely appalling in terms of navigation, to find any information on the website, you must navigate the entire website dictionary. Not to mention the pages upon pages of useless code (meaning the pages don't work). I will save you some time by giving you a few pages that don't work - The Baggage Calculator, The COVID 19 Related Documents Uploading Page, The login and Sign Up pages, and a ton of the characters and typography. All I can say is whoever is doing the code for the Lufthansa website needs to fired. Let's move on to baggage. For a long-haul flight, I feel like a personal item (a purse or backpack), a carry-on item (a small bag), and a checked bag are acceptable, especially considering the flight was $1,500 USD. But no. Not on Lufthansa, you have to shove everything you need for a 10-hour flight into a single carry-on bag that must weigh under 8kg. I work with technology for a living and what I need for my job alone weighs 8kg. Unfortunately, I will not be able to pack everything I need for the next 2 years into two bags, so I looked for how much it will cost to take 3 bags. There is not a dang thing on the website on how much it costs to check another bag. So I call Lufthansa. Nothing. So I call again. I could not get a hold of any operator or person even within the business hours, nor would they let me wait on the phone for someone. No contact, how convenient Lufthansa. Website flaw, maybe, customer service flaw, absolutely. It is now just 22 hours away from my flight. I currently live 2 hours away from the airport and can I check in for my flight online...nope, I have to check-in at the airport conveniently located nowhere near me. Oh and just so you are aware, the Lufthansa check-in page doesn't work either. All in all, I would not wish this kind of stress on my worst enemy and lord do I hope that you the customer are not flying on Lufthansa because you won't even be able to check-in for your flight. The worst part is, I haven't even gotten on the plane and I have read bad review after bad review on the actual service and food, so that might be another review coming soon. Pray for free alcohol so I can forget my Lufthansa experience or just don't fly Lufthansa."

Our plane was delayed leaving Boston for an unspecified reason. We were more than an hour late arriving in Frankfurt yet there was not a single Lufthansa employee meeting the flight to assist with connections. The gate where we arrived wasn't even within sight of any airport monitors to check for connecting flight information. My connecting flight had already departed by the time I found the gate. It is just mind-boggling to fly into an airline's home airport on a delayed flight and not have anyone to assist passengers with connections. I found a help desk that booked me on a later flight several hours later. I wrote to Lufthansa to make them aware of my bad experience on May 11. I provided copies of my ticket, boarding passes and reservation. Several days later I got a response from Lufthansa asking for most of the passenger and flight information I provided in the initial email, so I replied again giving them the exact same information that I'd already provided once. It's now been more than 5 weeks and I've still not gotten a response."

On arrival in Bucharest one of our luggage failed to arrive in Bucharest. After a 27 hour flight, we had to waste another three hours at the airport to queue to register the lost baggage.  While in the lost luggage office, we received an email from Lufthansa saying that the luggage was delayed and will be dispatched to us at an address of our convenience. They gave us the tracking number and we filled the forwarding address for the luggage. But then after 3 days, the tracking stopped without notice and we lost the trace of our luggage. Last it was seen in Frankfurt we believe. Now, there is no one to contact and the lost luggage office in Bucharest states that there is not much they can do. They advised us to wait and call them everyday. But this hope for the best approach is not what we expected from a company like Lufthansa. We could not believe that we have these problems with such a reputed company as Lufthansa. Now we are afraid we'll have the same problems on our way back to Sydney."

I have been a Senator Member of Lufthansa since many years and always enjoyed a fantastic service. However, since last year the service level has nose dived, be it the ground staff or the cabin attendants. Everybody seems to be in a foul mood always and absolutely not bothered to make the flying experience of its passengers pleasant. In my last flight from Frankfurt to St Louis the quality of the food was pathetic to say the least. It seems the quality of food that was served earlier to Economy class is now being served to Premium Economy. The Economy Class food is not up to the mark of Lufthansa level. Last year I had a very unpleasant experience at Valencia airport while travelling to Dubai and I couldn't fly. I had to buy an Emirates flight as an alternate as it was an urgent journey and I was more than surprised with the excellent service and the quality of the flight. I wrote about the unpleasant experience while checking in at Valencia to the Customer Service in Lufthansa and never heard back anything from them. I think it is the time to ditch my fidelity to Miles and More and look for an alternate if the service levels are not improved."

However, once we got there after waiting in a 35 minute line for customer service, we were simply told this is the wrong line and to walk “that way” toward the double doors. In an airport that big, you think they could give better directions but no. Then once again, we asked for more directions and their ambiguity of directions appalled me. However, after searching for the “correct” customer service for half an hour, with little to no help from anyone we found it. They were very accommodating and put us up in a hotel 20 min away from the hotel free of charge. However, we asked if we could get our luggage so we could have our change of clothes, our toiletries, etc, and they weren’t able to do anything because “they were already headed to our final destination” which I would have understood. However, as I landed in New York this morning I received a text message that my bag couldn’t be loaded on schedule, which leaves the question as to why I couldn’t get it in the first place. I was flying home for a surgery for a fractured jaw so I thought Lufthansa would be a bit more accommodating due to that fact, but no. Not at all. So I am now left with no contacts, no toiletries, no clothes and the hassle of having to reschedule doctor appointments and surgery. On top of this, my TV wasn’t working on this 9 hour flight and after telling them about this, they didn’t do anything to try and fix it or accommodate me. I will never fly this airline again and hope no one else will either."

Of the 4 flights on my round trip all 4 were delayed, and my luggage was lost both ways. On arrival at Frankfurt there was no personnel to disembark us so we were stuck for a half hour on the plane which almost made us miss our connecting flight. The first return flight was late, of course, so we had to sprint in Frankfurt airport not to miss our connecting flight. I arrived on Friday evening, it is now Sunday and my luggage still hasn't been delivered, so not only was my trip an absolute mess but I've had to spend my weekend at home waiting for my luggage. Any information pertaining to the delivery I've had to go fishing for myself calling any number I could find, and the least I can say is that they were hardly helpful at all.

If you call the service desk, they are never able to assist. The app is also not of assistance. If you want to upgrade your seats, the service desk is not able to assist or they claim everything is sold out but ask people to keep an eye for availabilities. We naturally did this, and last minute upgraded our seats, only to realize that they sell it nearly for free in the airport - this to advise that we tried to upgrade to business via phone but was told that it was sold out. In the airport they sold business cheaper than we had bought premium economy seats at the day before. Business was nearly empty on the flight and we were not allowed to upgrade in the airport, despite wanting to pay for same, as you can only upgrade once. When boarding we were shocked to see the seats, as the pictures of the class on their web is absolutely not picturing what you actually get. On the return flight, we again wanted to upgrade, as one of the ticket holders got injured and upgraded to business by the insurance company. We managed to upgrade the rest of us to prem eco only to find out, than in 3 weeks they had removed the ""all incl"" in the prem eco, hence limited avails of the drinks (both soft and alch). This wasn't even mentioned while being upgraded. Entertainment on board is very limited or not working. Very few movies, games platform not working at any of the flights and the wifi was not working on any of the flights. The food back from Mexico was not edible - and we are really not having high thoughts for food on board a flight - but when you pay a fortune to get food on board, then you should at least be served food which is being well cooked in order to eat it. Pancakes served for breakfast was not even fried enough to be able to eat it. Lufthansa is a very expensive low class company, which take money for everything without delivering the services paid for. This may have been the last time flying with them - at least alternatives are to be found now for our long haul flights."

Once onboard, staff did not greet us, but directly inquired about the seat row. We found the seat area in business class poorly cleaned and with visible traces of spilled drinks from the previous flight. No welcome drink was served, as is usually the case on Lufthansa. Once airborne, we were served a sausage salad, which was one of the most appalling airline meals I’ve ever had. As dessert we were offered an apple in a paper bag, which we declined. Drinks were served out of synch with the food - here as well the service standards were poor, as all drinks were served lukewarm (including the sparkling wine).

The flight was OK but i really felt the food and drink situation was terrible. Johannesburg to Frankfurt was about 10 hours. The first meal consisted of a salad of carrot, squash and aubergine, a roll, a cake with raisins, and a dry pasta with some tomato sauce. Initially, I thought that as the plane was full and I was at the back of the plane that this was the left over option. It transpires that there is only one option and it is vegetarian which doesn't bother me but might others. The pasta was pretty horrible and really felt like something a student might make. Just past and a bit of tomato sauce. the salad was small and bland. The roll and cake were fine. The second meal (breakfast) was a yoghurt a cereal bar and a dry sandwich (also vegetarian). Beer and wine are complimentary but spirits are not and come in at about 7 euros. No snacks or nuts with the drink service though you can buy them. The seat was fine, the entertainment system was difficult to use and had an average selection. The second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda which was around 15 hours due to closed Russian airspace was in airbus. The plane was new and clean and the entertainment system was easier to operate. However the food and drink situation was the same. In fact the same nasty pasta was served this time accompanied by a couple of chopped up lettuce leaves. breakfast was the same too. I really felt that for 15 hours on a plane there wasn't much food. I understand that times are tough for the airline industry and that probably Lufthansa are cutting costs with the food and drink service but times are tough for the passenger too and being fed not very much and of poor quality on two different transcontinental flights is a poor showing especially on what is supposed to be a premium airlines."

We call again (several times) to get a confirmation that our pet would be joining us on the flight, we were given 4 different responses, but always promised the confirmation will arrive by tomorrow or 48hrs or 72hrs (depending on who we spoke to). One month passes by and we give up and decide to leave it up to chance arriving with our pet at the airport with the hopes we can take him. But it doesn't end there, about 1.5 months after booking our flights I receive another booking confirmation email for the same flight and the price was taken from my account. So I call and cancel that flight and received a refund of the full amount. I know what your thinking ""It must end here!"", think again. On the day I received my refund I had two more transactions taken from my account, totaling the amount that I was just refunded! In our preparation to move to another continent, I had missed these transactions coming from my account. So the night before my flight, as I was checking in, I noticed and I called explaining my story to the operator, she was no help at all as we were trying to figure out this issue. The call then dropped. Calling back again I got another operator and at this point I wanted to speak to someone with more knowledge, so I asked for the manager. He told me this isn't possible and that he can help me, I expressed that I have called about a dozen times to simply get a flight for 2 people and a pet, I've been booked on the same flight twice and charged three times. At this point I just wanted to speak to someone with a bit more experience. I was put on hold and told it wasn't possible for him to do that, but he did direct me to their website to request a refund, (I mean come on, that's the best you can do, submit a refund for a flight that I've already cancelled?). I thank him for and submit the form, but there was nowhere to upload the documents. So I called again, explained the situation to another person and I was giving an email to send my bank statements to and now I wait! But all in all, this experience with Lufthansa left such a bad taste in my mouth that the whole experience was horrible. There will not be a next time. I will update this review with a result, if there is one."

On the other hand, beverage service was very good and they made four rounds on this 3.5 hour flight. The crew were very friendly and well organised. If you have time to grab a bite to eat at the airport before your flight, Lufthansa is certainly a good choice on this route."

My wife's ticket was upgraded and she got her seat number, but I didn't get mine. I saw the charge was already taken from my bank credit card for both of us. I called customer service, after a long wait, they answered. The Philippine call center said it wasn't an upgrade for me, it was just for my wife. I checked many times and I saw that they took money out from my bank. I ask him we don't want to fly separate so to return my wife's ticket to its original purchasing and refund the money, they said it was not possible. 50 minutes spent over the phone for nothing. I called again, another agent was completely ignorant, same story but this time she said my wife's ticket was not upgraded either. I said she was wrong, even though I stated that I had a computer printout and I got the Seat number. 1 hour and 10 minutes waste of time. I called for the third time, I didn't give up. This time a new agent told me my wife's ticket was upgraded and to just go to check-in, don't worry, she said everything is fine. I hung up the phone, I didn't spend time for my ticket so I can handle mine at the airport. 45 minutes. I didn't feel comfortable, so I thought I'd check one last time before going to bed. Unfortunately, the seat number has changed again and it has become economy class. I called again, 48 minute wait. Inconclusive. By the way, every time I called, when I wanted to talk to the manager, they said that they were not available they are helping customers, I asked them who am I? I think I am also a customer.

When they finally arrived the flight was delayed for another hour due to the weather in Frankfurt. So we were late for over an hour and missed our connection to Chicago. It took us almost two hours to find an open Lufthansa service desk. Three of them were closed. We had to go thru the control to get to the open one So hour and a half later (7pm) the lady at service desk told us that we have to wait till next day 10.45 am to continue our journey and she gave us hotel accommodations off the premises of the airport and there is a shuttle to take us there. 30 minutes to get to the shuttle stop we had to wait for the bus for an hour and a half to find out that the shuttle is not equipped for handicapped people with the chair. Somehow we managed to load my grandma on this shuttle and when we came to hotel they had no ADA equipped rooms or even elevators. We did mange that (I had to carry her again) and went back to our flight in the morning. We were told at the gate that we will be preboarding before everyone else. That didn’t happen cause the person who was suppose to open the elevator for us was nowhere to be found. So we had to wait till everyone boards and then walk through all the people to our seats.

Late departure, cramped seats, underseat storage was only 3 half-size slots for 4 people (not big enough for a regular size backpack), none of our bags fit, the entertainment system was exceedingly slow and crashed 5 times leading to a blank screen. The flight attendants ignored the call button, I rang it 4 times in 30 minutes and they never peaked out from behind the curtain, I could hear them chatting on the other side, there were numerous other call lights illuminated in the cabin - all went unattended. When I arrived at the transfer airport, they shuttled us all onto our new flight only to wait several hours on the tarmac before telling us that the flight was cancelled. When we were returned to the terminal, the line to speak to customer service was about 500 people long. I waited in line for an hour before an airline employee came and told a large group of us that there was another service desk on the other side of the terminal with no line. He led us all the way across the terminal only to find that the line was easily twice as long. I ended up waiting in the new line for another 2 hours. When I finally got to the front, I was told there was only 1 seat left on any flight on any airline to my destination within 48 hrs, it left 31 hours after my original flight and I had to take it now or leave it. I took it, only to find out on my way to the hotel that I could have rebooked my flight in about 60 seconds via the chat bot on their website and caught a flight within 2 hrs (it had multiple seats available) By the time I discovered this, it was too late to return to the airport and catch the flight, so I had to spend a night in the stopover city, arriving at my destination more than 24 hrs late. The entire experience was a nightmare and I don’t understand how they’re still in business. Speaking of which, the taxi and hotel immediately knew that I was coming from a cancelled Lufthansa flight, it seemed like all of their business came from customers in the same situation.

Most of which was sparse and totally inedible. The crew after service was conspicuously absent having blacked out the cabin. At lighting up time 1 hr 45 mins from BKK. Another “offering” was handed to me. Mostly inedible, a comically bad sandwich. The sum of all I could stomach was a bread roll and a yoghurt for a ten hour 50 minute trip.

I had bought round trip tickets from Marseille to Quebec for a price of about 700€ in November 2019. The outward journey in January 2020 and the return in April 2020 (Quebec-Montreal-Zurich-Marseille). During the Covid crisis, all flights, including all companies, were cancelled. For Lufthansa also, the company modified the flights, telling me that some of the internal flights were to be modified, around March. It took hours with customer services to find and agree on another internal flight, only for the trip to be cancelled two days later. This has happened several times. The company is now cancelling all these flights in April, which is understandable in view of the global crisis. The postponement of flights is done on the month of May, where the customer service simply tell me that my flight has been moved as is to the following month. A few weeks before departure, internal flights were also cancelled, forcing me to spend hours on the phone to get a new flight and keep my trip. Once done, the flight was cancelled again, telling me that the company had no flights in April and postponed my trip to May. It's also the same story when my May flight date arrives, hours on the phone to change an internal flight after it was cancelled only to be told that my flight has to be rescheduled for June. Except that I consulted the company's website to check if a new reservation was possible. Indeed, the company was operating flights but the tickets were close to 5000$. The company's strategy was simple, postpone my flight booked in November 2019 for 700€ to avoid losing a seat which was then sold at five times. I had to buy another ticket (from another company) to be able to return. Obviously the actions to be reimbursed for my return have never given any answers."

But one of its biggest disappointments on the service front is its lack of consistency. On some short-haul flights, the service has been excellent, being addressed by name and frequently checked on if I needed anything, and good food, and on others the service was almost nonexistent. On boarding my flight at Heathrow, and from Munich to London, there was no priority boarding, but the first ten rows ushered in first. There was no welcome, and Anti-bacterial wipes were handed out, but not on the return flights. On the London to Munich sector, breakfast on board was quite substantial, with ham and cheese, cereal, but with cold bread and croissant. On the flights to Rhodes and return to London, the food was unappetizing. One expects a hot meal for lunch and not a concoction of something cold. On the flight from Rhodes to Munich, there were only two passengers in the business cabin. However, the lunch was swiftly served, cleared within about 15 minutes, and the crew not seen until landing. Overall, although there was no interaction with passengers, the cabin crew was efficient and polite. On the drinks front, seconds were not offered, and I had to ask for them. As for seating, it is as most European airlines are, with no extra legroom, except for the middle seat left empty. I was disappointed with the downgrading of Lufthansa's overall in-flight service, and only give my thumbs up for good value when it comes to the ticket price."

The return leg of my journey was 13hrs, we were fed 1hr into the flight and then once again 1hr before landing, only one meal was hot. After waiting 11hrs to be fed again they served a nasty sandwich . There was no snack provided, despite the FAs telling us we would be given a snack mid-way through the flight. The only hot meals provided across all flights was the same vegetarian pasta. I’m a bit hung up on the food, but these are extremely long flights and I’ve flown this route several times with several other airlines and have always had good experiences with the meals considering it’s such a long journey. The best part of my journeys were the staff, however. Cannot fault them. Someone had taken ill on the flight and they really went out of their way to ensure the passenger was okay, always providing drinks and checking up. They were kind and professional, definitely one of my favourite FA teams. My short flights were fine, up and down quickly so not much to say. My fare was also amazingly cheap considering the route so I guess I did get exactly what I paid for. I’d fly them again, but not long haul."

Boarding was slow and messy requiring passengers to queue to have their documents checked, then queue again to check our tickets, then queue again in the jet bridge. What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime. Almost any other full service airline would have provided some sort of food service. It is already low cost carrier like to only have paid food services.

The meal choice was poor (only veggie pasta on both legs) and the service of the crew left much to be desired. It seems like the lack of customer service just gets blamed on Covid. Worst of all was the terrible spacing/leg room in economy class. It is big enough for a 10 year old kid but not for a normal size adult. It really felt like the airline wanted to cramp in more passengers to make up for the losses incurred during the pandemic without any regard to the comfort of passengers. On the second leg of our journey we even wanted to upgrade to premium economy or business class but turns out since the FRA-JHB route is so busy, both flights were fully booked. As a Miles and More member I was deeply disappointed. I usually don’t complain about airlines and I’m not pleased I even had to write this one.

When i called them when I saw that I was not refunded a few months later, they started by saying that it is my fault and people should stop trying to blame them for the cancelled flights since they chose the lower tier ticket. Even when I explained to her, that I was not even allowed to enter the country even if i wanted to take the flight, she kept saying it is my fault for doing that and not reading the fine prints. Needless to say, i always prefer to pay extra and know that my ticket is refundable, but in this case the non-refundable fine print was really fine I guess.

The service was very good with a good choice of food and drinks available on the flights with generous portions. The IFE screen was superb and there was a good selection of movies. The seats were large and with good leg room but somehow found that the lower back support was not very good. However the on-ground experience was not as good as the premium economy experience with other airlines especially on the Delhi to Frankfurt leg of the flight. Lufthansa does not have a separate check-in counter for Premium Economy and did not offer priority boarding as well on the Delhi Frankfurt leg but did so on the Frankfurt - Chicago leg which was a bit strange. Frankfurt was a very comfortable airport for transiting with a lot of comfortable seating across the airport and good food options.

Anyway it was better than the uninspired  sandwich Lufthansa served in business class on previous flights I took with them recently. Seats in business class are the same as in economy with the seat next to you kept free which is a plus giving the feeling of being a bit more Covid safe. Disembarking in Frankfurt was at an apron position and all passengers were packed together in a bus that drove us to the terminal. This really didn’t feel Covid safe and I really disliked this. If they have to bus passengers to the terminal can’t they just not divide the transfer in 2 busses so people don’t have to stand shoulder to shoulder during the drive?

It started with check in, which in Berlin is done by a contract company that is not able to provide its agents with accurate information on entry requirements. I had a long argument with the agent who nearly refused to issue my boarding passes although I had all the necessary documents with me (and no problem at all at immigration in Dubai later). Flight from Berlin to Munich on time, but otherwise nothing to praise about it. Lufthansa has introduced a buy on board service on domestic and European flights, but they didn't offer anything on this flight, so even if I had wanted, I couldn't get a coffee or snack. Munich airport is very easy to transfer, but repeated document checks at the gate resulted in a delayed departure. First time flying in Lufthansa's premium economy, and while I liked the seat comfort and additional space, it's disappointing that the service has been reduced to exactly the same as in regular economy, apart from a tiny glass of juice after boarding. They also cut the nuts or crackers with the first drink round, and they now serve coffee or tea together with the meal. That doesn't make any sense as your coffee will be cold once you have finished the meal. On the other hands, portions are shrinking year by year, so there is quite a chance that the coffee is still warm. Lufthansa definitely has to improve its service in economy, otherwise I will avoid them in the future."

Lufthansa failed utterly in providing the basic of this product. Most of the Lufthansa A320neo aircraft have no WiFi. And there is no other form of entertainment.

I checked with Lufthansa at the airport right away and filled the correct report – I was instructed to do nothing more and to call Malta Airport and check the next day and arrange for delivery. The luggage has still not arrived and it is 2 weeks later 09.01.2022. From what I was told by the Lufthansa desk in Malta they tried to communicate and investigate with Vienna with no response. From what I can see on the Lufthansa tracking on their site the baggage was sent on 28.12.2021 from Vienna to Malta, and then for some unknown reason from Malta to Frankfurt - however, Malta Airport is reporting the luggage never even landed in Malta. Since then I have had to contact Lufthansa who claims there is no report even made, I have called Frankfurt Airport, Vienna Airport, and Copenhagen Airport to try and get some assistance, I have been passed around and have to communicate with Central Baggage Services and World Tracker – this is beyond infuriating and also just simply unfair as Lufthansa should be able to at the very least guide me in what to do and see where the error happened.

The lounge at München airport was good, not too full with a decent selection of food and drinks. The ground staff was nice and the air hostesses; chatty and helpful. Seating on European routes is not that good, but with flight times under 1,5 hours that's not really a problem. The food was the most pleasant surprise, with fine regional German food, presented in an attractive way. When I mentioned this to one of the cabin crew, she told me that the offerings had recently been upgraded."

We had 6 small flight changes, all fine. We then received an email asking us to call (a premium number) where we were told our last connecting flight had been cancelled and were offered an alternative that left before our other flight had arrived. I explained this was not an alternative and was told there was nothing they can do. I was told to cancel, which would have cost us over £2000 extra due to now booking last minute. I was hung up on 4 times by various agents (including one who just started taking other customer calls with me on the phone line). Eventually we managed to rebook with an increased travel time of 12 hours and after having spent 4 hours on the phone at 40p per minute over 3 days. The customer service is appalling. I have also complained via their email complaint line and have been told someone will get back to me 5 times in the last 4 weeks and have heard nothing."

The actual flight was perfectly fine and I had no issues with it whatsoever. However, circumstances arose where I needed to re-book the flight (not cancel, although one should be allowed to cancel a flight during the middle of a pandemic and receive a significant portion of their money back) with Lufthansa for a different day and customer service was shambolic at best. Long wait times to talk to someone with a very hard to understand and thick accent only to be told that the flight I was requesting to change to, which was a cheaper flight, would actually cost $500 more despite initially paying for tickets that allowed you to change your flight without crazy fees. When pressed as to why the flight would be more expensive when anyone can look it up and see the cost vs. what I paid initially, there was obviously no response. Queue being put on hold again and then being hung up on leads to this review. Lufthansa makes it easy and oh so pleasant to take you money with flat pandemic platitudes (re-book easily with no fees) but they are an absolute nightmare when such circumstance arise."

Also, they do it efficiently - the delays are within normal limits, the luggage has arrived on time, the check-in process was okay and the aircraft was modern and quite comfortable. As for the in-flight service - it has changed for the worse so dramatically that from now on I will try to avoid flying Lufthansa. I used to fly transatlantic several times a year and Lufthansa was always a good option - not anymore. On a 12-hour flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City (10,5 hours backwards) they don’t even offer meal options anymore! They just shove you a vegetarian pasta which is edible but unsatisfying. The “breakfast” is also vegetarian, both times it was a tortilla with cheese filling, it was cold and stale and I couldn’t eat it though I was hungry. On the 3-hour flight from Frankfurt to Moscow they don’t even serve free drinks - they give you a 300ml bottle of water a tiny chocolate bar at the end (you can grub several if you are really starving). Coffee and probably some snacks you can buy from them - that’s how it works now. In general, food service is a disgrace and the flight attendants are polite but very abrupt. With their masks on, they are like robots - gone is all the niceness and kindness and good humour. All they care about is that your mask is covering your nose properly at all times. It’s more like a sanitary convoy, not a service, and that was the impression throughout all 4 flights with them that I’ve had recently. For comparison, my colleagues were flying the same route with other airlines and literally everybody mentioned better food that I’ve had and a friendlier service. So, I am disappointed and will try to avoid flying Lufthansa in the future."

Outbound flight from BHX to FRA was half full so had lots of spare seats. A bottle of water was provided with some chocolates. FRA to SEA was 60% full so we were able to move around the cabin and find seats with more space. The crew were really friendly and when serving drinks told us to have two as they weren’t coming back for a while. The food was standard ok. The return flights were a lot fuller and the crew came round less often but this wasn’t a problem given it was a night flight. My only gripe is the IFE system on the a333. There were two different systems - one that was similar to a tablet and one that was a sort of tv. The former was fine but the latter was so laggy that you touched the screen and it choose a different option. This meant passengers were poking the screen meaning that those sat in front of them were disturbed. I do wonder whether covid has been used to reign back the food and drink options"

I would like to thank Lufthansa and its airport crew Cristian Lenz. He is a life saver! On 13-14th of July, 2021 my family and I had to fly Lufthansa Miami - Frankfurt - Kyiv with 2 month old baby, but our flight from Miami delayed for 2+ hours because of weather conditions, we missed our next flight, so, in Frankfurt we asked to give us any flight even through other Germany city, just to get home faster at the same day, so, we've got such a flight with extra city. We were so much tired, with a so little baby, so many and hard flights. At that (third) city (i don't remember which exactly, it was just for transition), we were already exhausted. We forgot my small bag at the airplane with my phone, documents, bank cards, money ut already couldn't return for it. I was in panic, cause in 1.5h we had another flight, to Kyiv. I, with a little baby on my hands, saw an airport crew guy - Mr Lenz, told him about my trouble. Truth be said I didn't think he can help, i thought he sends me to the special service for finding things  as most are doing.. But he said: don't worry, take care of your kids, I will get it for you. I was very happy. The airplane already wasn't at the place, Cristian did real magic and found that my bag before our next flight. I appreciate it so much! I even don't know what we would do, especially with 2 month old baby, who was already very tired. I'm so grateful this Person for His heart and willing to help.

The flight is completely full and the boarding was chaotic without much prioritisation of the Group number. Most passengers brought along huge cabin luggage. The gate staff announced to encourage passengers to check their bags free of charge, but they didn’t go out of their way to pick some obviously large and oversized bags. Once onboard, the overhead bin filled up quickly. Cabin crew were standoff-ish, saying that it was not their job to facilitate the space arrangement.  The flight was further delayed because passengers continued to run up and down the aisle to find space. Once arrived in Frankfurt, there was nobody at the gate to facilitate connecting passengers, so everyone ran for themselves. My second flight FRA-LHR was also further delayed for unknown reasons. Upon boarding, I was told to go to another gate staff to have my documents checked for COVID & locator form etc. The other staff  refused to do it because it wasn’t her duty, whilst the one holding that duty was nowhere to be found. Once onboard, again, similar situation with the overhead bin space reoccurred, but this time the male steward were slightly more hands-on than the previous flight, but they still could do more. This trip wasn’t the first time I encountered LH cabin crew staff’s attitude towards assistance with the overhead bin space. Since before COVID, I’ve gradually switched from BA to LH as my preferred full-service airline, but the LH cabin crew attitude is making me think twice on my future flights, especially LH has now scaled down the inflight catering whilst BA started to offer some free stuff

The company canceled the inbound flights twice where I had to call multiple times to have them rescheduled. Within one week of our travel, they canceled (again) the last leg. When I called (again), this time, I was told that the full ticket was canceled and, there were no other available flights for November or December. The free flight change would only cover flights to the same destination within 7 days of the initial booking dates. If I would like to reschedule for January onwards, I would have to pay 1100 Euro per passenger. Or, according to customer support, the best option was to get a refund and book the flights with another company. Being close to Christmas (a peak period) increased our travel costs by more than three times. Even worse, we are traveling because of our wedding ceremony scheduled for December 4, 2021, limiting our flexibility options. We had to postpone our wedding for more than one year due to the pandemic scenario and, now we receive this unpleasant ""gift"" from Lufthansa, which will add stress and increase costs. Thank you, Lufthansa, for such a disgusting treatment. I will never fly with Lufthansa again in my life and, to all of my contacts and social media, I will strongly recommend avoiding this company at all costs.

If this is their strategy to attract full fare paying guests in Business they really got it wrong. It’s an absolute disgrace for people paying so much money expecting a standard above average.

I had multiple serious issues on the ground and in the flight, when Lufthansa staff demonstrated a full ignorance or arrogance to the passengers. The numerous complains to the support line result in formal response without any real measures. The COVID pandemics worsened this disaster service even to more catastrophic. I could provide my personal tens of examples how the Lufthansa employees treat the customers in bad manner, starting from business lounges and further at boarding and in airplane, however, this review is not aimed to make a long story but just to express the general status of the services by Lufthansa. Last but not least, recent changes in price policies and in-flight services just confirm the general trend of company degradation. For example, on some international flights longer than 2 hours (flight FRA-LED), which I recently used, there is no more complimentary food/drinks service. The ticket price, however, increased!

The 747-8 is a gorgeous airplane and I do hope Lufthansa continues to fly them even as others discontinue this awesome Jumbo. Check-in : Easy, friendly service. In-Flight Service : Very friendly and accommodating as Lufthansa has been in the past. Seat-Comfort - Due to the half empty flight, I was happily able to stretch out. However, even in a full flight, the seat would have been above average by economy standards. I can recommend the mini-economy cabin in front of economy plus on this particular plane. Food/Beverages - Good selection of beverages. Meals were fine (Ravioli for dinner and a sandwich box for breakfast), but nothing special by economy standards. No choice food alternative choice was provided. Entertainment - A bit of a more dated touch system, that was a bit sticky to navigate, but overall a good selection. WIFI - Offered, but not used by myself. Overall one of the better long-haul USA-Europe flights I've been on."

Finally, after standing in line to see the cashier I managed to get the required number that proves my luggage was prepaid. Why are you asking your customers to prove that they paid for the luggage?

They gave me an option for an intermediate leg that starts about 6 hours later from Frankfurt and options to cancel it and ask for a refund. I cancelled an intermediate leg as it is of no use as I cannot magically transport myself to Frankfurt and have my luggage automatically loaded in the aircraft for an onward journey. When I clicked refund my ticket, it errors out on their site and asks you to contact their customer service. I have been on hold for more than 2 hours on three separate occasions and yet unable to get in touch with their customer service. An email sent to their customer service to process my refund came back with a canned response from a DONOTREPLY email address. I have started the process of disputing the charge through my credit card company because according to their flight cancellation email I am entitled to a refund, just there is not way to request a refund online or via phone.

The good news first. Both flights were on time. Both planes were clean. Both crews were courteous. Then the bad news time comes. Online check in was disabled. I arrived to check in desk at CDG2B 3 hours before departure (guessed that all who normally use online check in should be already there). My guess was just partly correct. Not just all Lufthansa, but also Swiss, Austrian and some other airlines sadly shared 3 or 4 staffed desks to check in all the flights to Munich, Frankfurt, Zurich, Vienna and God knows where else. The queue was endless and moving in the slowest possible pace. Things looked quite scary, so I opted to go directly to business class check in with my Turkish frequent flyer card (unsure whether eligible for that). After some 25 min of wait (at business class line folks) I was checked in and given tags for my carry-on.  Boarding was a mess. Calling passengers by groups (to lessen physical contact I guess) gate agents then asked everyone to form a standing queue near the gate door within a small space providing close physical contact. Then the gate door opened, so people were able to board, and without airline staff guidance things got back to normal. Onboard it was ok. The seat back recline has been eliminated since new A320NEO came to fleet, so seat comfort is now not on par with low cost carriers. A bottle of water and wet napkins were handed out. We took off and landed on time. Disembarkation in Munich also went by groups. It slowed things down, but not badly. Then boarding flight to Kyiv was another stupid quest. Without any announcement all the passengers were re-directed to another gate. There instead of boarding we had to get our boarding passes stamped. But with stamped boarding passes instead of boarding the plane we were diverted to the initial gate where they were trying to enforce boarding by groups ignoring the fact that stamping passports was not done by groups, so they were finally able to form quite a big disorganized crowd. Boarding took forever and some more covid infection was spread in this interesting way. Onboard it was uneventful. Overall disorganized, incompetent on the ground, uncomfortable in the air, overpriced and unworthy. I tried their inflight wireless. My CC was charged granting me access to Wi-Fi with no Internet available. "

Today I have called 3 times and and after staying on hold for 15 minutes, the call goes dead without anybody coming to the phone. It is been extremely frustrating for me to get my money and I am starting to think Lufthansa will not refund this money.

480,✅ Trip Verified ,N Helscher,Luxembourg,17th September 2021,"""My daughter was denied boarding""",,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Vancouver,August 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My daughter was denied boarding.  The adventure began already in the night before the flight when I tried to check-in my daughter electronically. This was not successful, because electronic check-in of LH asks whether or not a visa is available. In an exchange program, there is no visa, however, but an ""application approval"" and the visa is issued at the local airport upon arrival. Such a possibility is, unfortunately, not available within the electronic check-in at LH and electronic check-in could, therefore, not be performed. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. As soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. However, only an electronic check-in was possible there. This check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. Therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. After a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. Although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. When she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. Despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines I have experience with close their gates just before departure, LH refused to accept my daughter. Lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also LH has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. Not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of LH. All in all, I consider this procedure unacceptable. Two days before departure, I wanted to clarify one more point with LH and called LH's information desk at 23:00. According to the information on LH´s website, the support line is open until midnight. The announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. Since the clarification was important to me, I decided to wait. After waiting until 23.50, I hung up. I think that this example about the customer orientation on the part of LH is meaningful enough and no further comments are needed."

It was explained to me, that, as this was a day flight, there was no reason for the kits to contain earplugs and eye masks. For the same reason, there were no pajamas offered. One alcohol wipe was given to each passenger upon boarding and this seemed to have taken care of all hygiene concerns, as I did not see the bathroom cleaned during the flight. C-class bathrooms contained no amenities. Beverage service was the only thing that seemed to be alright. Food was poorly presented and of a sub-par quality.

I booked a one-way CGD-FRA-HKG trip at the last minute to replace a cancelled Turkish Airlines flight and Lufthansa took me to my destination safely and on time. Check-in at CDG on an August Sunday afternoon was just one long queue for all Lufthansa and Swissair flights (despite buying my ticket online, check-in via the app was disabled). Even arriving two hours in advance, you would have very little time to spare to reach the aircraft given how slow things were going (luckily I was spotted by an airline rep as having no luggage to check in and was moved to the free business counter). The A320 to Frankfurt was new and spotless. The crew went around handing out a single alcohol towelette to each passenger in a great display of hygiene/safety precautions (other airlines give you masks, gel, wipes, etc). Each passenger was given an individual bottle of mineral water  and Swiss-style chocolates. That was it, for an early evening flight. On the FRA-HKG leg, there was no choice of dish for dinner or the usual apology of ""sorry, we have run out of"" -  some penne in tomato sauce. Breakfast was very skimpish and un-German (picture).

After the trip I had contacted Lufthansa about 25 times over the phone and just about as many through their email and social media. I requested a refund back in may and was told I will receive money back in 7-10 days. I called back 3 weeks after and they was no idea what refund I was talking about, they stated that there was no ticket for a refund on my account. It took me 3 hours and 4 attempts to get a hold of a live person, since the first 3 either hung up, or put me on a 30 min hold and then hung up, the representative that work for this company have zero respect for customers time and money. I always asked very politely to not disconnect the call and to call me in case we get disconnected. Not a singe Lufthansa representative called me back after hanging up on me. So I finally get to talk to a person and they supposedly create a ticket for the refund of the booked seats ($106) and they again tell me to wait 7-10 days. So I wait, 3 weeks go by, nothing.

Seat comfort was very good - seating arrangement in Business at Lufthansa gets often bad reviews, however I do prefer their open concept to many pod arrangements from other airlines. Food was served speedily and was of excellent quality. Even though the flight was fully booked (actually overbooked due to the need of having to accommodate apparently a cancelled flight to Toronto) crew managed to be very attentive, quick and always friendly.

Moreover, if there is a government-imposed travel ban, they will not allow you to have refund (only rebooking, usually at a very high price because the last-minute booking is usually twice or three times the price of the original ticket). Other flight companies allow for refund, but Lufthansa is instructing their call service to deny the refunds and rebooking cannot be done online. To rebook, you need to call their call service, which is a nightmare. I tried to rebook 3 times. First time I was on hold for about an hour.

I waited in line for about 5 minutes and then was allowed through. I ran to my gate and arrived at 8:50am. I handed the lady at the gate desk my boarding pass and she simply said.. ""The plane has left"".  I asked her how the plane could leave early when they  have a manifest that shows there is a passenger on this plane connecting from a flight from Belgrade. She simply looked at me and said ""I'm sorry the plane is gone"". She then handed me a card that had a Lufthansa website address on it to lodge my complaint.

Second, my bag did not arrive in my final destination. Strange considering I had one connection in Frankfurt of several hours, which is where Lufthansa's automated system says the bag was held up. I filed a report with the local baggage service at Bari airport, but customer service directly with Lufthansa has been poor/nonexistent. I have not been able to reach anyone on Lufthansa by phone in Germany or the US. The calling service offers no way to leave your phone number for a call back.

It is sold to you that this is possible on the Business Saver Class, with the extra price to be covered by you. Rang up Lufthansa, they wanted to charge me €276 euro as they had no Business Saver seats available, so Business ++ was the only option. I said I would be happy to downgrade to a regular seat, they replied that you can downgrade at the airport, not on the phone, and then tried to get me to pay the €276. Just before I paid i asked will i receive the difference in fair price between the regular class and the business Class already paid. No was the answer."

No consideration for family traveling with kids. As of now I can't cancel my trip and online service doesn't allow you to do so. We should have more reliable service when you have an emergency.

Check in was methodical. I had on a cloth mask and was told I could only wear disposable masks on board the aircraft, the flight attendant gave me a fresh new disposable mask. Seat comfort was marginal at best, typical economy class seats for a long 10 1/2hr flight. Service was prompt and efficient. Dinner was a pasta with sauce palatable but I've had better. Breakfast prior to landing was a sandwich. Flight attendants very efficient. The 747-8 provided a very smooth flight albeit with some minor turbulence over the Atlantic. This aircraft had the old familiar livery of LH which I actually prefer to their new livery. Landing was smooth, deplaning very interesting. Passengers were required to remain seated until their rows were called to deplane which actually made existing the aircraft very organized and orderly unlike the US carriers where it's every one for themselves.

My flight was supposed to be at 10.35AM. The day before the flight on July 24th, I went online to do my check in and just want to make sure everything is okay then I noticed Lufthansa had cancelled my flight without booking me another flight back to the US, meanwhile, I paid for round trip. So I spent last day of my vacation 4 hours on the phone trying to solve this issue. First, it’s so hard to find a valid number to call Lufthansa for customer service. When we finally found a number to call, then it says they only work Monday to Friday. Long story short, I finally was able to rebook my flight for July 25th at 9.10AM. Boarding is so slow and inefficient. We were supposed to leave at 9.10AM but we did not leave until 9.40AM due to slow boarding. I originally paid/ booked premium economy seat, while they rebook me they downgrade my seat to regular economy. Then I have a connection flight from frankfurter to JFK at 11.00AM. While in the air I asked a crew member that I have connection flight if I can still make it and she said yes, if I ran. I ran through the immigration and I asked the guy who worked at the immigration again if he thinks I can make it then he told me he doesn’t think so because of the gate is very far, the farthest gate it’ll take me about 10+ mins if I run (Z68). When I finally ran to the gate, airline employees told me the boarding has closed. I missed my flight while my other fellow American who ran with me said while they were told this connection flight will wait for us. Then we were told there is no more flight out to NY JFK anymore for the day. We can either wait until tomorrow or go to Newark NJ. (But my car is parked at JFK long term parking). Then we have to go to another gate (Z12) to the counter in order to rebook our flight. Anyway, so I took that flight at 1:20PM (again they put me in regular economy while I paid for premium economy). Because of the whole chaos that Lufthansa put me through now I end up in Newark. So I have to figure out an Uber home or arrange pick up by friends while I have my own car parked at JFK where I booked my final destination to. Lufthansa, are you paying my one extra day of long term parking? Are you going to refund me the cost difference between premium economy to regular economy? "

I chose Lufthansa for a number of reasons, mainly reputation, route, price, and recommendations by others. I must say I was extremely disappointed. Terrible infotainment system - slow and clunky. Terrible economy seats - they recline but the seat pad does not move forward like others airlines such as Emirates, Turkish, Ethiopian, etc. Many rude flight attendants. Unsurprising given most are German, but still, should be more pleasant. No meal choices. Every other airline I have ever flown has offered at least some food choice ~ meat, chicken, fish, etc. Not Lufthansa! It was pasta with tomato sauce and wasn't even tasty. I sent emails to the Lufthansa customer relations department. Here is the context of my email. We traveled from Frankfurt to Johannesburg on flight LH572, departing on June 3 at 22.05, which lasted approximately 10 ½ hours. During this time, we experienced disrespect, rudeness, and overall unpleasant attitudes and service by some of your flight attendants. We were seated in row 32, seats G, H and K. I understand that food is limited, however, when we inquired if our daughter could have an alternate meal, the female flight attendant blurted out “Everyone has the same thing! If you wanted a special meal, you should have requested it before the flight.” That’s fine, but the insensitive and rude behavior of this flight attendant was not acceptable, by any culture! When the plane pulled into the gate at Johannesburg, the fasten seat belt sign was turned off. I stood up to stretch my legs as I am tall and my knees hurt. Again, this flight attendant shouted at me to “sit down until you are told to get up!” Is this the type of behavior that is tolerated by your airline? Based on reactions from other passengers on this flight, I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect, almost disdain, by some of your flight attendants, as I was not the only passenger she yelled at.

I called back and asked the customer service person how this was possible if there was no space. It was explained that Lufthansa was not letting anymore people rebook on this flight, the space left was only for new bookings. So, to get back for when I needed, I had to make a new booking on the Monday flight at a cost of EUR 138.49, because the representative refused to rebook me on this flight.

Even in Frankfurt some Business Lounges are closed. We got access to the Senator Lounge. Even there, no food or drink service was offered, only some packaged items.

She told me that there was no such flight scheduled for Brussels at 12.00 and if there was earlier on the flight was cancelled (12.00) and that the next one was due at 21.00 and there was nothing she could do. She also told me that is is not Lufthansa's fault that the flight was cancelled and that I should have been informed about the cancellation by booking.com from where I had booked this flight. This when the exchange between us got heated and and there was raising of voices despite the fact that there were other customers in the queue. Eventually she told me that there is nothing she can do and waved me off. This really shocked me because I am sure booking.com cannot cancel the airline's flights and the responsibility of getting me to my destination is on Lufthansa. But more surprisingly, is the fact that they never bothered to contact me about this. I had to travel to my destination by train hoping to be compensated for this inconvenience. On my return to Helsinki, both flights were late again. Upon arriving in Helsinki at midnight, my suitcases went missing. Again there is no traffic during corona time so I did not understand this. Helsinki airport was a graveyard, there was no one to ask. So for one hour I just walked around the airport looking for help which I finally got and I finally filled the form. Since I arrived late in Helsinki, I had to get a hotel room and pay for taxi as there was no direct bus to Turku at that hour. The next day I spent money buying essential warm clothes. I obviously a claim form and sent an email to Lufthansa requesting for compensation for the inconveniences: canceled flight and the cost incurred during the period (6 days) my luggage was missing. When they finally got back to me, I was shocked when they said that it is not their responsibility that Lufthansa canceled my flight and therefore they will not compensate me for the train ticket. They never apologised for the late flights and time spent looking for my luggage that led to me missing the last bus to Turku. In total I had spent 315.95 euros during this period, however, they refused to compensate me the full amount and only decided on 123 euros. "

Of course was my fault that I was on airport only 2 hours before, that machine stopped working and that they don’t have enough people working.

I had planned and packed carefully knowing I’m a woman going to a conservative, patriarchal country. Doesn’t matter, Lufthansa left our luggage in Frankfurt. I didn’t think too much of it to begin with because half of the time I travel international they lose my luggage. But normally they get it to us the following day or the day after at the latest. If we didn’t have 5 multilingual, wonderfully kind guides from our tour company constantly harassing Lufthansa and the airport carriers, I don’t think we’d ever see our luggage again. At first they told us to come in 2 days later before we flew from Cairo to Aswan and they’d have it for us to take with us (since they have the same flight coming in every day). It never was put on the plane. Then they tell us it will be sent to us in Aswan. We’re there for 2-3 days so they have time to get it to us before we get on our Nile Cruise. They never tried to send it to Aswan. Now we just heard we won’t get our luggage until we go back to the Cairo airport and retrieve it in person. Why? Because they honestly don’t care. They don’t think it’s their problem that we don’t have our luggage. Reminder that we’re not just in a foreign country, but in Egypt. We have a body guard assigned to us from the Egyptian government to escort us whenever we leave our hotels. “Go buy some essentials and we’ll refund you 50% of the cost.” First off, even refunding me 100% of the cost is not enough to even begin to cover this inconvenience. There’s clothes, snacks, and other items in my luggage that I bought specifically for this trip that I’ve now bought in vain because I will never use them.  I saved up money, which is precious right now during the pandemic, to come here and enjoy myself! If my luggage was delivered to me in a timely fashion, I wouldn’t have been able to relax and enjoy myself rather than almost have a breakdown.  I’ve gone through experiences while traveling that have been less than ideal to say the least. I can honestly say this is the first time I’ve ever experienced an airline that is this incompetent. I will never fly Lufthansa again. "

What a mistake ! Our return flight from Crete to Brussels on the 19th November was cancelled and the proposal we received by e-mail was a flight from Athens to Brussels. When I called their customer support the first proposal was a flight on November 30 (11 days later) leaving 6:55 in the morning and arriving 20:50 in the evening. There were flights available leaving 6:55 arriving 10:50 several times a week but we could not be booked on those because we did not have the right booking class. I was asked to call again later, maybe other options would become available. The next time I called the proposal was even better: we would leave on the 29th and arrive on the 30th (a stay in a hotel was not included). I could contact customer relations if I did not like this, which I did. The only answer I got from them was that their customer services were able to handle this problem. After calling 5 or 6 times they finally arranged a flight for us: on the 1st December. At least that was what I understood because when I received the e-mail it said the 5th. When I tried to get this changed I was told that I would have to pay because I confirmed their alternative. When they were calculating the cost they ended the call so I gave up and booked a flight with another airline and got home without problems. Off course I did not want to throw away the money I spent on the Lufthansa ticket so I tried to rebook it for next year. Again a huge mistake. If the flight was booked as a return flight on their website it would cost only €8 more than my original ticket, but as a single ticket it would cost € 150 more.

Seems they had an error in their system and that the transactions did not go through and they did not inform me. The personnel at the airport asked me to claim for a refund on the difference between the online and the airport fees, so I did. After I explained my case, Lufthansa recognized that it was their fault but they would not give me my money back. I insisted to talk to a supervisor and I was denied to do so.

They never bother to notify if they do not process before the committed timeline and when I call back they say it will take another 10 days and this is endless... the call centre team is the worst, they cannot direct me to the refund team as it is internal and they cannot give answers on the timelines because it is managed by the refund team!

The only option for arranging rerouting or obtaining refund was through call centers, which took hours to reach. Unbelievable. When checking in, the ground staff wanted me to pay for checked baggage, which I had already prepaid online. Hadn't I printed the receipt and had it with me at the airport to prove it, I would have lost 50€. I didn't enjoy the flight itself either, as the refreshments on board were cancelled without previous notice, only water was available. Overall the worst experience with an airline I've ever had."

I was told my suitcase will go straight to Athens and arriving in Munich I had only to go to the gate and with the given boarding card to get the plane to Athens. The flight LH0453 arrived in Munich about 3 hours before the 2nd flight. In about 30 minutes I was in front of the gate for my 2nd flight to Athens. To my surprise, 20 minutes before the departure, the Lufthansa person stopped me and did not allow me to get to the plane. I was told that I needed to have the PLF form from the Greek authorities. At the check-in in LAX nobody told me anything neither before when a few days earlier I had called Luftansa. Instead, they had assured me beeing a US and Greek citizen I did not need anything else. This time, 20 minutes before the departure of my flight to Athens, I was not allowed to enter the plane and I had to stay in Munich until I fill the PLF form. Although they had given me boarding card in LAX, they forced me to stay in Munich airport without any assistance  and they refused to put me in a new flight the next day with the excuse that my ticket was a United Airline ticket and not Lufthansa. This is the worst experience I have come across. The Lufthansa people in Munich did everything not to give me any assistance and to ignore me. They did not want to help me finding a hotel around the airport nor another flight next day, they did not even want to give me my suitcase that was already on the plane to Athens. "

The connecting Airline (United) informed us that we will not be able to take our pet inflight, and would have to make arrangements such as flying her as cargo (which, being a flat nosed dog, would be a risk), or re book ourselves with Lufthansa, as it was their booking. I told my kids not to be worried or afraid. To keep the focus on the goal - which was, all of us reaching safely, home to TX, to be with my Husband. Well, we watched United Flight take off, sat down for a family talk as to the next steps. We had our tickets, pet passport, a credit card, free Wifi, our Optimism and willingness to adjust. The Lufthansa service counter Staff were awesome! They listened to our story in detail. After a conference with their Manager, we were informed that they could put us all in their flight the following morning. So, we customized our sleepover at the airport. Their reclining chairs to sleep, sandwiches carried in our bags for dinner, showers the next morning at the Airport transit hotel with great free coffee & hot chocolate.

I also received the confirmation email from Lufthansa about my rebooking and it said my flight was confirmed. Today, I rang Lufthansa and the customer services told me my ticket with Swiss Air was not issued so I cannot take the flight on 25th October, the one I thought I was going to take. Then I rang Swiss Air and they told me my reservation is in their system but the ticket is still the old Lufthansa ticket for 27th October, so they cannot issue me a new ticket on the 25th flight. Meanwhile, I was told there was no Economy seat but Business and First on the 25th Swiss Air flight. But on the 1st of October, when the rebooking was incurred, there are plenty of economy seats on that flight. Besides, there are other flight options in October. Now, I was told there are no available flights in October. I'm so upset and disappointed with Lufthansa, this has totally disrupted and ruined my plans and it will cost me significantly. I have urgent business matters and I need to be in Shanghai on time. If Lufthansa did not provide me the false information and told me right at the beginning (on the 1st October) that the rebooking is not successful then I would still have other options.

Today I called customer service in Johannesburg as there is a flight on 29/10/2020 which connects with the second leg and this was rapidly processed with no mention by the seats. The confirmatory email arrived with no seat allocation and mention of our not having seating included. I called up customer services again and was told there was a R2 difference in price per seat so they could refund the entire cost of the tickets (read as wait many months to get our money back) and rebook and pay again.

Then, less than one week before of the flight date, they cancel your booking and put you in the flight that costed the least. I arrive to my  destination at 1am in the morning without the possibility to take any public transportation. So end up paying for the most expensive flight, original train tickets and the new train tickets. Apart from that, they use to serve some drinks and snacks.

I had no requested this and after a brief discussion the whole thing was dismissed with indifference and lack to interest on their part. Upon boarding to my surprise people I saw that in fact passengers were sitting in the ""non-bookable seats"" .. no Covid19 distancing as implied by Lufthansa. In addition to being incompetent during the booking and boarding process they were also lying about their ""responsible seating policy"", Additionally boarding was more chaotic than normal, people queuing in the aisles, moving from the back to the front of the plane: evidence of the Lufthansa “dynamic seating process”. During the flight the FAs handed out 3 documents in a disorganized and giggly fashion, requesting us to complete them. The request was in unclear/garbled English and German. When unable to fill out 1 form (as none of the options applied to me) I asked the FA how to proceed: she replied “I don’t know, I´m just a FA, just fill in something!”  One form was handed back to the FA, the other 2 had to be handed to the French authorities at passport control/security at Lyon arrivals. There were no officials at Lyon arrivals, no passport or security controls. One document was only valid for nationals from non-EU countries (plus UK, Norway.) The FA clearly had not understood the forms she was handing out. On the return flight I received a “Boarding Gate change” on my phone, the new gate being quoted as G26. As I was unable to find any “G” gates I asked a security guard where the G area was (no ground staff were at the original boarding area). We were then called to board (at the original gate) only to be kept standing for 15 min while the confused and theatrical ground staff gave us unclear and contradictory information. We we bused to the plane (overfull bus). I saw 2 “low-cost"" airlines using airbridges. "

When pushing her about cancellation routines (eg sending out an email) she avoided the subject.

The outbound flight from Prague was great. They only gave out a bottle of water during the flight, but this is perfectly acceptable for a 50-minute flight.  Frankfurt airport is operating out of just the one terminal: Terminal 1. This means that the terminal was cram-packed full of people. There was only one restaurant open and it was expensive and the quality of the food was pretty poor.  The flight to Bilbao was approx. 2 hours, and during this flight they only gave out one bottle of water per person - all in the claim that it is because of COVID-19. The following morning, I received an email from Lufthansa - apologising that there have been changes made to my booking and asking me to either accept the new conditions, or choose not to and keep the flight open. The problem was that there was no alternative flight option shown. Lufthansa cancelled my return flight and didn't give me the option of rescheduling my return flight on 24th July. I went online and entered my booking details into their site and only my outbound flight was showing up. My ticket had been changed to a one-way ticket. I tried calling their customer service number but after multiple attempts - they just don't pick up - I gave up. I also sent them a couple of messages, using their contact form, but again, no response. "

The only difference this time is, I have to deal with their customer service, and this is where it goes down hill. In February, I booked a ticket for my girlfriend to come visit me and unfortunately, the pandemic hits. The airports get closed and the ticket flight gets cancelled. As I read (or mis-read online) there was supposed to be a button in the online environment to click to issue a re-fund and so I did. Time goes by and of course they violate their own policy of returning the refund. The real problem for me starts in their communication. I've been trying to get hold of their customer service for the past 5 months by e-mail or by phone. Their phone lines are either flat out busy or cut out after 2 hours of being on hold. I've gotten hold of their employee's once in twenty1 hour calls.  I've gotten some written feedback but basically, none of it was anything more than that they acknowledged the situation but can't provide any help. Feedback on my ticket telling me they cant respect their deadlines.Me forwarding the claim to my credit card company. Lufthansa re-reviews the ticket but tells they can't help me without any argumentation. Creditcard company tells me I need a statement that my flight got cancelled (which i didn't got), so I re-approach via a ticket. I get hold of Lufthansa once by phone and they inform me I cancelled the ticket myself  because their system processed my action as a cancellation and they mention to me they can't see the flight was actually cancelled. Spoiler alert, the airport was closed, it was. I'm advised to re-make a flight disruption ticket to explain this. Here is specifically ask for a confirmation of the flight cancellation. Not a refund but instead of sending me that, they issue me to the refund department. Here I realised they are playing a game with me, because the moment they send me the cancellation confirmation, I can get the money refunded via my credit card company. "

The staff at Lufthansa business lounge, which I had a pleasure to try, was rude, abrupt and unhelpful. The boarding process on the other hand very well organised thanks to using the group boarding procedure. The flight was ok, on time and without any issues. The refreshments (salami sandwich, apple juice and water) were good quality and fresh and the cabin crew were also nice. The pilots didn't give any information on the flight, something I always appreciate in other airlines, such as BA.

Being 30 minutes from the airport, packed in a car with the kids, dog, luggages, dog cage, we called the given number. It was busy for 25 minutes than the Customer Service confirmed the fact that no dogs allowed in hold on Lufthansa planes from that day. They don’t look for an alternate solution for us and if we don’t fly without the dog (How could we? What should we do with the dog?), it is considered a no-show situation. At the airport the frustrated Lufthansa staff confirmed the same. So we stuck in Toronto, lost our tickets and may be the chance to get back home in this crazy times. I know that these days/weeks are extremely difficult for all of us but the way how Lufthansa left our family with confirmed tickets on an other continent showing no interest of finding any solution for us - this is very disappointing.

I´ve asked him what the solution would have been and he didn´t have any information regarding it, therefore as I had to go back to Vienna due to work business I asked him to rebook me to any flight within the star alliance airlines, and he mentioned just the possibility to fly via Brussels, although there was still a spare place via Zurich with SWISS. I received an Email confirmation with my flight to Belgium with Brussels airlines and proceeding with an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna. I wanted to check- in online but on Brussels airlines it was not possible, but for the flight with AUA yes. I was a bit concerned, but I thought due to the strike this could have been normal. I arrived a bit earlier to the airport and at the check-in counter by giving them my documents their answer was “we don´t have any flight booked under your name” I was very furious as it was looking like there would have not been any solution to fly back on that day. I had to talk to other three people, until someone could have started helping me out for it, the only supervisor for five star alliance in an international airport… ridiculous, and neither from the airline but from the group S.A.V.E., company operating in Venice airport. They had to call several times, many Lufthansa desks until they told me they would have had to rebook me on a flight via Zurich (the one I´ve seen the day before, but which was never offered to me…) It was a kind of realizing news they gave me, although I was stuck at the airport for about 4 hours as it was way much earlier my scheduled flight to Brussels.

At that point I had no choice (could not just leave my skis at the airport) and opted to upgrade my flight for $400 but the ski bag had no additional charge (free). I find this to be very poor on Lufthansa part since their agent on the phone quoted the wrong price. At the same time the check in agent at O'Hare displayed unprofessional behavior refusing to address this issue. The flight itself in their Premium Economy was below average product.

However, an airport representative for Lufthansa met passengers on the Manchester flight straight from the plane, and seamlessly guided us through the airport, involving a drive down the highway, so we were able to catch the flight with a few seconds to spare.

Temperature was on the warm side upstairs and when I mentioned this, as I woke up very warm, something I was not used to, I was told ‘it’s always warmer upstairs than downstairs. Went downstairs to business to check and the temperature was much better. Screen size for entertainment is good but for a screen that is that far away, the writing for the menu etc should be bigger. Had to put on my reading glasses to read the on screen options. Left FRA an hour late due to long taxing and de-icing, but pilot made up time to arrive into HGK 40mins late. The person who served me was nice and personable, the rest were just going through the motions as quickly as possible. Went to the kitchen a few times to get water. Had to ask for ice and was served out of almost flat mineral water bottles. Soft drinks were served out of bottles into glasses, small amounts, had to ask for more. Food was reasonably tasty but nothing special and portions were small. More of a Degustation size/type menu than proper meals. Very disappointing. My wife and daughter, who were sitting further up front could not get another croissant nor the scrambled egg choice for breakfast because they were none left and the server was grumpy to them. On this particular flight, the non-engagement and lack of empathy to me from some of crew was only exceeded by arrogance in offering this mediocre service and menu."

Extra alcohol was served to drunk passengers that were singing the whole night on my flight to Madrid and they kept receiving more alcohol - so we could not sleep the whole night. Today Munich to Beijing and to finish ruining my trip we are a family of three with an infant and this airline brag about being “family-friendly” well they have given us seats separate all over the plane - no help and no respect.

Overall very positive experience. Short hops between LHR-FRA were on new A320-neos in both directions and were perfectly comfortable with a small snack provided. Long haul A340-300s used to Chennai say they are 'operated by Lufthansa Cityline' but the passenger experience is identical to normal Lufthansa. Seats are comfy enough with adjustable headrests, sufficient pitch for 6'2 male and decent recline for night flying; managed to sleep almost 5 hours! Although the planes may be getting on now, the interior feels very freshly refurbished and still love Airbus A340/A330 planes in economy with just 2-4-2 layout - much better than Boeing's now standard 3-4-3. Entertainment was good quality screen with decent enough selection with probably about 70-odd movies though a poor selection of mostly German TV programmes. The meal just before Christmas was delicious goose, sauerkraut and dumplings, and with metal cutlery too, then a small sandwich-sized snack before landing. Toilets were kept clean (though maybe best to avoid being too close to them as they got a bit whiffy at times and with all 5 loos together in the middle of the plane, lots of footfall during flight), cabin crew were efficient and were perfectly friendly with me - as a German speaker they seemed to reserve a special extra level of smile when someone spoke German, but I saw several being very direct with other non-native English speakers regarding putting bags in lockers and one seat assignment at the start of the flight. An Indian chap in his 40s found someone sitting in his seat and sought help from an FA to talk to the person, to which she replied condescendingly, ""I think you're old enough to ask that yourself, aren't you?"" That aside, they were good, the pilot kept us informed well of minor delays and most flights arrived on time.

There was a 15 min delay from HEL although we left on time and the plane parked at the furthest gate (K03) in the satellite terminal, which forced us to run like horses first to the train between the terminals, then to passport control and again to the furthest gate (H08) in the main terminal. We made it, but some connecting passengers didn't. Moreover, my spouse's luggage was left behind at MUC and we're still waiting for the bag at our Bucharest hotel although the agent told us the bag would to reach us by Monday afternoon. MUC-OTP is operated twice a day by LH. LH sells very tight connections through MUC (30-50 min between flights) which seems to be too optimistic.

Finally contract ground service arrived and two women loaded me into wheelchair and sprinted me through concourse, Passport Control, through tunnel, up elevator and then onto electric cart for high speed ride to Gate Z 69 which was at least a mile downrange, still.

Of course the responses came from another company that appeared to be from India. Beware of dealing with Lufthansa, it cost me $9,000 and I received nothing."

I was very pleased with the service and treatment received by the various flight attendants. They were professional, friendly, efficient and cheerful. The flight was overall pleasant and the food served was very good for airline food. I was a bit surprised to see so many people standing in the aisles when they should have been seated with their seat belts at least loosely fastened.  Lufthansa has long been my favorite airline for a long list of very good reasons, just some of which I've already listed. As a dual national, originally from the US but now living in Israel, I fly El Al more than I would choose if I had much of a choice.  I am not a frequent flier since I am a senior and a pensioner, but I try to make at least 1 or 2 trips outside my present home country per year. Munich airport does leave a bit desired for passengers I'm afraid since accessing the proper terminals and gates is via a train. Several signs inside the Munich terminal indicate terminal 1, but are in fact terminal 2. One should allow at least 2 hours between flights to get straight as to just where one must be in order to get to the proper terminal and gate on time for making connections for a continuing flight.

As it was a midday flight, a cold lunch/snack and warm bread was served, along with drinks. Comfort wise, there is no difference between Economy and Business seats. The seat pitch is the same, and though the empty middle seat offers more space, considering this is just an hour flight, it did not make any difference. The experience on the outbound journey in Economy and return on Business was just the same except for the food and bar service.

Despite the connection in Frankfurt (I was coming in from London), I find this flight more enjoyable than some other alternatives. On boarding, I was offered the usual nonalcoholic welcome drink, and we were away on time. Once the bar service was opened, I opted for a scotch on ice, but with a half litre bottle opened, I got a very small drink served! That was followed by a tasty lunch, wine, and I settled down to watch a movie on the IFE. The choice here is a very limited (compared to the likes of Emirates). On my return flight, which was late night, the service started with drinks and a delicious beef sandwich. 90 minutes before arrival a bland breakfast was served consisting of omelet and cold items. The seating on Premium Economy is very comfortable (2x3x2). The usual water bottle and small amenity kit was also provided. But as I was at a window seat, stepping out to use the toilet was difficult, especially as the passenger in the front seat had his seat reclining. My fellow passenger had to get off his seat to let me out. Overall Lufthansa offers a polite and efficient service, and good value for money, if you're not fussy about dates and times."

Soon after take off, unlike some other European airlines, a pastry snack and drink was swiftly served. Service, was formal, non-engaging, but quite adequate. However, on landing we had to be moved to a far away parking slot and it incurred a long bus ride, and further rail ride to the actual allocated terminal area.

When I got up to stretch and stand I was told within 2 minutes to go and sit down by the rudest stewardess I have ever encountered. She also badgered other passengers throughout the flight. There was also no safety briefing at the start of the flight and all the announcements were so garbled you couldn’t understand what they were saying, in German or English. There was no offer of assistance while de-planing and no offer of assistance in regards to where we go next for our next flight. Once we arrived in Frankfurt we were almost run over (literally) by a golf cart doing at least 15-20mph! We had to walk almost 2km to get to out next gate and when we went to the Lufthansa service desk for directions there was no one around (of course).

So we had to run back all the way to Lufthansa to then be told they could get us on our original flight. In form of “compensation” they offered us €250 each and put us up in a hotel with a shuttle bus from the airport. But like the previous promise of another flight, the shuttle was non existent so we ended up paying for taxis out of pocket. Next day when we arrived early to follow the given instructions about the compensation once again, no one knew anything and everything they told us was wrong. The only thing we could do was file a claim online. Of course this is a very convenient way of not dealing with customers. I called and was told if I wanted to make a reservation of course I could talk to someone, but if I have a complaint that can only be done online, nice way of avoiding responsibility and not facing your many unhappy passengers. We filed the claims, I sent all the required emails and have received no reply. I am very frustrated with what I consider to be lies and lack of responsibility.

The Senator Lounge in Berlin is in free fall. There was a lot of talk about the new Senator Lounge. In the end, the new one is worse than the old one. The choice of food and drinks is very limited. For breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. The croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. There is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. Shame on Lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the German capital. The departure from Berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. However, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. As I was in a good position overlooking the apron, I knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in Frankfurt. The aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. In Business Class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. For me, there was enough connecting time in Frankfurt, as I knew exactly how I could get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 quickly. I spent some 20 minutes in the Senator Lounge. It was quite empty for that time of day. The food served reflected the fact that the Oktoberfest in Munich had started. It was all very Bavarian – the same you get in the Munich lounges all year round. Within the 50 minutes I was in Frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from B30 to B20 to B27 and finally to B28. The flight from Frankfurt to Tivat was the real disappointment. The flight was more than twice as long as the inner-German flight from Berlin to Frankfurt, but the food served on board to Tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. I mean how is this possible? How can it be that Lufthansa – a so-called 5-star airline – offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? Frankfurt is Lufthansa‘s main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. Is that the impression Lufthansa tries to leave? Austrian, a Lufthansa-group member, is able to serve a hot meal on all international flights no matter how long it is. Why is the parent company, Lufthansa, not able (or willing?) to do the same?"

Overall they ended up taking additional layover and spent an extra 7 hours on their trip. I asked for a partial refund I was told $300 refund in June 2019. Customer support has asked for same verification documents over twice so far. It’s October 2019 and no refund has been issued yet. They don’t respond to email for days, when they do they ask for the same information that was already provided to them months ago. Very frustrating and poor customer service.

Accidents happen on a daily basis and nobody or no company is perfect but they went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied. We truly appreciate their generosity and concern.

We took off quickly, and it looked like an on-time arrival at FRA. The weak point is the food and food service. The flight kitchen at NBO seems to be unable to deliver quality food, at least not for business class. Compared to Swiss, which flew us to NBO, Swiss is worlds better, incl. the food. FRA airport is a complete hassle, and LH should not book short connecting times. We barely made our ZRH flight, but were the last ones showing up at the gate.

Having connected from Dublin, spent some time on the Senator Lounge which offers a great selection of food and beverages. Boarding was fairly orderly but started late. LH appears to be losing its discipline when it comes to on time boarding and departures. On board, the hard product offered decent space for one’s belongings but the fact that not every seat has direct aisle access remains a downside for LH business class. The seat offers limited privacy and the fact that it is angled towards the neighbour, makes it quite awkward in the fully flat position as a mere 1 inch divider separates the respective foot wells. The seat was narrow compared to business class seats found on other carriers. It was not particularly comfortable in the lie flat position. The service was in typical LH fashion, efficient but lacking warmth. The food and wine offerings were quite good however, the salad consisted of limp mesclun greens and was sort of thrown onto the tray. The snack served prior to landing was actually better tasting than the lunch offering consisting of a delicious soup and very tasty prawns. The IFE had a good selection and I especially enjoyed the cameras showing the exterior of the aircraft. The toilets were kept in immaculate condition throughout the flight. The flight departed late and arrived slightly behind schedule. Having flown on a number of other 5-star airlines, I found the overall experience not quite on par with LH peers in this category."

Now, before I took this flight with my dog I made sure the flight will be the most comfortable as possible for her. The rules are that dogs can fly in cabin as long as they are secured in their carrier during take off and landing and when the seatbelt light goes off the dog is allowed to sit in your lap. I asked the rules several times before traveling because she hates being in a carrier and goes crazy barking and crying. I even got her tranquilizers from the vet just for her to be able to deal with those few minutes she has to be in the carrier. This is the way we traveled to Europe a few weeks ago. Nice and smooth she made it thru.  Lufthansa banned me from flying their airline because my dog, who came out of her carrier by poking her head out, mid flight and was barking! This pilot demanded At the beginning of the flight to keep her in the carrier the whole flight and told me that that is the rules. My poor dog hates being in the carrier, I probably would’ve not brought her if that was really the rule because she barks and cries when she’s in the carrier. I asked the pilot why he would not use his own discretion with his rules, for my dog will make the whole plane crazy by barking while being locked in a small box. It’s the rules.  I did what he told me anyway and my dog barked for 25 minutes straight while I apologized to the other passengers. So we landed in Frankfurt to catch our connecting flight to Miami and the stewardess told me that we cannot board the plane. Mind you that flight to and from the US, ESA’s are allowed to sit on your lap the entire flight, landing, taking off and all. I was not able to board my flight in Frankfurt and was told to order another plane ticket with another airline, and that I will not be getting a refund or will they transfer my ticket to another airline.  When I demanded a copy of this so called report that was written about why I have been banned, no one could give any answers, no one could give me a real reason why I was not able to board. "

Hardly time to visit the toilet and certainly not opportunity to go into the Lounge. At the boarding gate I asked about my luggage and I was reassured by the staff, after checking the computer, that it had been transferred successfully to the second plane. After boarding the plane, lunch time, we were informed that there was no catering service at all due to the recurrent issue that they have had .. for over 2 months now. But being served just a wafer is totally unacceptable, they didn't make even the effort to get us a sandwich despite departing from their main hub. Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid. I had to beg then for having it express delivered on that night (only Senators and HON members are entitled to such privilege) despite being Star Alliance Gold and Lufthansa Frequent Flyer. Fortunately the staff took pity of me and they managed to get it approved by Lufthansa. Needless to say that I sent the feedback form to customer services on the very same night. I requested for someone to call me as soon as possible. Instead, I have today (6 days later) the standard sympathetic email with the meaningless apology and the 'great' news that they will credit me with 10K miles and hope to see me on board again.

Lufthansa currently has a problem with its catering agents - it seems that very little food is available on short-haul flights in Europe. This downgrades the flying experience to something like that of a budget airline. On the short flight from LHR to FRA passengers were given one biscuit. On the second flight from FRA to OPO we were given a chocolate bar. That's it. That was the extent of the food service on the 2 Lufthansa flights totalling more than 4 hours. Additionally, a 10-minute thunderstorm in the Frankfurt are was converted into an arrival delay of almost one hour. There was little in the way of apology from Lufthansa.

I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference. I also want to add that in Boston at the check-in I was charged an extra $60 USD for my daughters check-in baggage. I had already paid for my one check-in back at the time of booking and was not expecting this additional charge."

I have found Lufthansa becoming more and inconsistent in their performance. On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team. I was for instance able to get off the plane before almost all premium passengers. In conclusion, not Lufthansa's finest day, by far. Would I fly them again? Perhaps, but they would not be my first choice, and they are not a five-star airline."

Our experience started on the way back when I tried to check in online. I couldn't do it as booking code I got by email was not applicable for Turkish airlines. When I contacted via FB Turkish Airlines I was asked to contact travel agency and get another booking code. Second proposal was to call international customer line. Not working processes should be airlines responsibility and customer service shouldn’t send me back and force but should take responsibility and manage by them self. After few hours communication in FB we decided to check in the airport before flight. Early check-in was important to us because we wanted to get seats on the first row to be able to leave plane ASAP to catch another flight because we had 50 min between flights. So we were proactive and wanted to do the best. In the airport representative of Turkish airlines was surprised that FB client support were not able to check-in and told us that customer service people can see another booking number which was needed to check in (clients are not able to see). I am not angry that situations like this happens, I am angry that nobody from Turkish Airlines wants to listen customer experience and move even one finger to improve they processes and client service. And day by day everything goes worst. Instead of asking to share feedback and send to responsible people to take a look what is wrong everyone is shaking heads. So my try to share my experience in Istanbul airport was unsuccessful. At least I was able to check in and we got seats in the 8 row. But luggage was sent instead of Poznan to Munich. Probably she had already feeling that we will not reach Poznan tonight? Lucky we saw that on time and we asked them to redirect our luggage to Poznan. And for sure the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Munich was later then planned. We asked flight attendants if they can contact people on the gate and ask to wait. We asked passengers in the plane to let us go first to be faster. When we reached the bus to go to another terminal we asked bus driver if he would be able to contact gate and ask to wait 5 min (because we had to wait 5 min for bus schedule). Answer was no we cant so we had to wait. When reached Terminal number 2 we ran as crazy (maybe somebody could explain me why?). And I came to the gate 6 min late, and plane was still there. I was not allowed in. Now time to look for the hotel in all city (closest Hilton is fully booked), because even this is my responsibility."

After waiting for 20 minutes, with all the other passengers, the gate changed to the one right next to ours-from 9A to 8A, causing an unsafe situation as some people were on stairs, some in the doorway, others forcing themselves closer to the front-and it was hot! After standing, waiting with no update, the people in the front were told the flight was being delayed. We finally left at 1:40. All passengers with connecting flights were stressed. The stewardesses reassured us that our flights would be held for us.  Then we were told they were short staffed, so only minimal beverages would be provided with a bag of pretzels. The crew were friendly and did their best. We finally land in Munich with previous scenario in mind that we would miss our flight, but a representative met us and raced us through the airport to the plane. Flight was fine, food fair, crew professional - last problem-three passengers luggage did not make it to EWR. Some people were looking on carousel for their luggage only to be told connecting flight luggage was around on the floor, go look for it! "

Firstly, to allow for traffic, we arrived earlier than the 3 hour window at EWR. Lufthansa would not let us check our bags until 5pm, so we had to wait 45 minutes even though there was no long lines at check-in. The announcements at the gate were not clearly spoken or loud enough compared to Icelandair which was right next to our gate. You could clearly hear their directions, but Lufthansa’s, barely. The staff were not as courteous as expected and seemed upset. We were late departing and when we arrived in Munich, our gate was occupied by another plane causing us to be further delayed in reaching our connecting flight. Since Air Dolomitit is part of Lufthansa, there should have been communication to hold the plane for us! Or at the very least, there should have been a representative meeting us at the gate and walking us to customer service to rebook our group of 22 on the next flight. Instead we panic stricken raced dangerously through this unfamiliar airport and then customs only to be told at the gate the plane had already left (if this was true, they actually left earlier than the departure time). We got to the gate at 11.11, no fault of ours. Then only a few of our group were given lunch vouchers and to make matters worse, our new flight departing at 2.25 for Florence was delayed. Not once, but twice-we finally took off at 4.00. "

Waiting at the Gate, no staff, boarding time passes, then 15 minutes after our scheduled departure the screen goes blank and people start to panic. A dnata ground staff shows up, casually announcing the flight is cancelled, we have to exit the airport, recollect luggage and return to the check-in desks to be rebooked. 120+ passengers all scramble to arrivals, we haul our 4 items and stroller with a sleeping infant as fast as possible back to check-in where we are told there are no seats available until the following day. So we are rebooked with Swiss. MAN-ZRH-VIE. Two hours before departure I recieve an SMS that our flight is 1h45mins late. We've been rebooked! Via Frankfurt. God no. We pack and walk over to the terminal and are rebooked via Munich. MAN-MUC-VIE. Finally, an on-time departure to Munich. The flight again affected by the ongoing catering strike. By this point, I just don't care. A rude stewardess initially refuses to provide us with a napkin when we are feeding our infant, responding ""you can get it from the toilet"", before thrusting paper hand towels at us. MUC-VIE on Austrian is again delayed by an hour after a discrepancy between the manifest and number of passengers on board (how does this happen?)! We finally land in Vienna 21.5 hours late. Add to the above the fact that Manchester Airport T1 is a total disaster, with understaffed security at the Assistance Lane we were forced to use, overzealous security staff, far too many shops and too little gate space and seating, a children's play area consisting of little more than a soft mat etc. Incidentally, inflight WIFI was available on all flights, but no moving map or inflight information which is a shame. And no screens on any A321/A319 aircraft all of which ranged betweeen 14-22 years old. Needless to say, I'll be avoiding the max 3* Lufthansa in the future."

Very unsatisfied. Firstly at the start of my trip, I almost missed my flight to Denmark from Frankfurt as my flight from Heathrow (Lufthansa) was delayed which made me have to run through the airport to catch the last bus to my flight (I must also add that I have asthma and needed to constantly use my inhaler during the process of running to catch my flight. On my return from Denmark to London I experienced yet another delayed flight except this time it was from Denmark to Frankfurt. By the time we were meant to be boarding the plane, it had only just landed. Once we touched down in Frankfurt it was already time to board my next flight to Heathrow. Other flights had a minibus to take them directly to their next flight, however, Heathrow did not. The gate for Heathrow was announced once we landed which we were told it was B41, this was a gate change from the initial gate which was B20. Once we had finally got off the bus, I and a few others had rushed out following the correct signage. I eventually made it to B41 which I was then told that the gate has moved to B47 which I then had to rush off to. I think that this is extremely unacceptable as this is now the second occurrence in the space of 4 days, and I am sure that this didn’t just happen on the 2 days that I experienced it, this is a continuous occurrence and something needs to be done to eliminate or even minimize this issue.

Lufthansa prides themselves to deliver what is called Signature Service in Business Class which means that every Business Class passenger gets assigned a personal flight assistant who is supposed to introduce her/himself to you after boarding. Ours did nothing of that sort. When I asked her, her response was a counter-question whether I would be missing something. Great service attitude indeed. We have been sitting in row 15 on the A380 (upper deck) which is separated by sort of a curtain from rows 10-14 despite all rows are supposed to be Business Class. As a consequence, we were entitled to watch how passengers in rows 10-14 were looked after by their personal flight attendants while we didn't get anything. We felt like being in sort of a second class of Business Class. I don't know whether this is common on LH flights on the A380 but it is unacceptable.  When the service finally started, we found out that other passengers got offered a salad between the started and the main course while we again heard nothing about it. Probably, it would have been too much of a nuisance to our flight assistant to serve us a salad. When the main course finally was saved, it has been the worst meal I ever had in 25+ years of travel.

As Lufthansa only operates one flight at night, baggage drop-off is only available 3-4h prior to departure, unfortunately. The Lufthansa Lounge in Dubai is rather small but offers a good selection of food and self-service alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. We had already eaten at the Ahlan Lounge before thanks to our Priority Pass and have to admit, that Ahlan Lounge has the better offering. But as soon as we were on board, we were glad to have chosen Lufthansa again! The service was just outstanding and ground staff made sure we were reseated next to each other (it was not possible during online check-in). We were offered drinks immediately and were shown the menu with food for later. As this flight was only a bit over 6h, Lufthansa was serving a light midnight snack and breakfast. Both dishes were really good and were met by a good selection of drinks. The seats in Business Class are full-flat on the A330 and offered a comfortable night sleep. It's not the biggest business class seats available, but definitely comfortable! In the morning we woke up relaxed and left the plane after a refreshing breakfast. I can wholeheartedly recommend Lufthansa Business Class! ="

When I got off the plane I expected there to be ground crew guiding people with connecting flights. But there was none whatsoever and we had to take an airport bus to the terminal. Once we arrived at the terminal no staff to guide us again. We had to run towards our next flight to catch the flight. Once we arrived at the gate for the next flight it was 2221, the guy said was it is closed. I explained I have been delayed by the flight from London. He said you have to exit and get someone to book your hotel and next flight. So we had to walk to the exit again. Once we got outside we were booked a hotel and next flight. We had to wait outside the airport for the shuttle to hotels. It took us 20 mins for the wait. Again no clear instruction which is the right bus. I am not saying it was any of the ground staff's fault as well but I think as a service industry the first thing an employee that represents the whole airline should do is to express empathy. Also the whole process would be made much smoother if only the airline could arrange 1 person at the arrival to say we are not going to make our next flight and it is closed or if we should make a run. It doesn't make sense for us to run all the way to the next gate to be given the cold shoulders.  There is, I felt, no passion whatsoever from their end, to make this a good travel experience for their customers."

I have mixed feelings about LH's business product. The check-in was ok (this time the BUD 2A terminal was totally empty, nobody was at the LH business check-in desk), the fast track security was ok, but the next step, the lounge was not ok. LH uses the Celebi Platinum Lounge at BUD, and the standard is around middle! Food selection is poor, quality is bad, there is no warm food at all, snack and sweet selection is pretty bad too, so I'd say this looks like rather a premium economy level lounge. I don't know if Celebi or LH upgrades or checks this lounge, but it would need a definite upgrade, cause for the business class ticket price, it was a disappointment. The boarding was ok both at BUD and MUC. On board, it is also a bit strange. The seat is not a business seat, it is an economy seat, only the middle seat left empty, but this is the only good thing one can say about LH's biz class seat. No bigger legroom, no bigger recline comparing to economy. The food is ok, there is no warm food, not even for a MUC-OSL route. The dessert was fine though (in fact it was better than the main course), and the tea was served in a ceramic cup. Bread was ok, butter was ok, though there was no hot towel. The pursers on both routes were kind and helpful. The Lufthansa business lounge in MUC was super, that one would have to be copy-pasted to BUD! And of course, it was nice to have the possibility to check-in two baggage (which this time I did) and to go on board with two handbags (which this time I did). All-in-all, nice flights with minor delay in the first leg, professional and efficient crew. If LH keeps on selling business class tickets on these prices, they'll  have to upgrade their services at some segments! O The wi-fi: even Norwegian, which is a  low-cost, is able to provide wi-fi for free, why can't LH? At least for business class pax?"

I decided to retry it since it was the best flight connection and LH flies the new A350 on the route.  Lufthansa business class remains among the worst in the industry. They put 6 seats across in one row which means seats are narrow with little to no privacy and very uncomfortable. There is only a small divider with the footrest of the next business class seat, which is unacceptable in my view. I found the food of poor quality as well which made the overall experience poor despite the friendly attitude of the cabin crew. I will certainly avoid flying Lufthansa on long haul in the future since other airlines  offer a much better business class product.

Food and entertainment were both very good, and we actually got some sleep at night! Coming back we found the smaller A359 felt quite a bit tighter and bulkhead seats lacked legroom. However, they’re still pretty good, and have a 2x3x2 configuration, unlike the stingy 2x4x2 for Singapore Airlines in premium which we also experienced. We feel that premium economy is really what ordinary economy should be like — you shouldn’t have to jam yourself in to ever tighter spaces, but today’s aircraft are getting worse in that regard. Lufthansa’s offering is one of the best in premium economy, comparing favorably with Air NZ and easily beating Singapore Airlines. We’d definitely fly with Lufthansa in premium economy again."

The fundamental issue was whether the extra cost for PE is worth it. After seeing that the incremental cost above economy was significant, I would say that it is not worth it. Extra leg room, food served on china, and an amenity kit are, in my book, not worth hundreds of dollars. I realize others may see this differently, but I could not justify the extra cost.

We booked a flight directly with Lufthansa on January 1st 2019. As this is a long flight we choose the airplane (wanted newer aircraft for more comfort) and to pay for a premium economy seat to have extra leg room and to be able to choose a window and isle seat so as to have no one next to each other. At the time the reservation and seat bookings were confirmed. 4 months later we noticed on the Lufthansa app that the following changes were made to our reservation without any notification - Our seats had been changed between Bangkok and Munich. (different seats allocated than booked).Our flight time has been bought forward almost 1 hour, aircraft type has been changed (New A350 to old A340 200). The aircraft operator has been changed (from Lufthansa to Sun Express) We then called Lufthansa to ask what and below is the response. First call we are told the flight had been moved to a different airline and we should contact them directly (Sun Express) and that Lufthansa cannot help us any further despite us booking directly with Lufthansa.  2nd call were told that this is a Lufthansa flight but this plane is not listed on there website as an aircraft used. The operator then said it was a different operator and I asked if there are any alternatives. The operator booked us on a later flight same day this time with Lufthansa. However despite asking if we can have similar seats and being told they are available (we were told we could book these afterwards on line) we then see a window and isle seat are not available. 3rd call we are told a window and isle seat is not available and to write a written complaint. At this point we are told this has been caused by a maintenance issue with the original aircraft and other people have also been affected. 4th call (as we still do not have the confirmed booking we paid for) we called again and we are told we can have a window seat but when looking at our confirmation we get allocated 14D and 14E but on the seat map this is a isle and middle seat, not a window seat. 5th call we are once again told our seats can be moved to a window and isle seat and have now been allocated 14A and 14C however when looking at the details on line we understand this may not be a window. Based on our experience this falls way below the level of customer service we expected and paid for when booking with Lufthansa. "

I was sitting near to this woman who was playing Solitare on her screen and the man in front of her could not just relax watching the movie because of the constant poking to his seat. It even led to some tiny conflict in the end. People who like to enjoy alcohol during their flight, should definitely consider these airlines over the other ones, since they are serving alcohol drinks like beer, wine, cocktails on international flights for free.

The staff at security would also not ensure that the passengers with flight could move ahead in line. There was a lot of chaos and people who could run were running, but people with disabilities or problems had to go through a lot of stress to reach to the aircraft.

The PA system worked in business class only. I had ordered an upgraded dining experience, and if I had been served what I had ordered, I would have been much happier.

Flying Lufthansa - A good airline. Using anything Digital the worst experience among all airlines.  Lufthansa (And Frankfurt airport) in general is a great airline to fly, with good planes, well maintained, great staff, clean, courteous, and efficient operations. The challenge is their digital experience.  For an airline this large, I am shocked at how bad their web sites and APPS are. The speed is so slow that I feel I am back in the days of dial-up service. They seem to have layered so many pages on top of one another, that when you click on a button, you wait 10 to 15 seconds for the next page to load. Then, when you think you have it loaded, some other layer loads on top, and moves the screen so you have to search for what you were just doing. I recently booked a simple flight from Frankfurt to Valencia, and it took me over 30 minutes to book online. I then tried the APP - couldn't eventually book it in the APP because I kept getting kicked out. I don't know if this is because of internet security requirements, or whether it is because the people that designed the Lufthansa internet and APPS are incompetent.

The touchscreen often registers your tap in a different location. Food: The food quality is ok but below the standard of other airlines. It is obvious that Lufthansa is trying to cut some costs. For example my meal included a salad that only had the leaf in it, no tomato or other vegetables that usually belong in a salad. For my chicken I thought they served me tofu because it was just some white cubes of something dumped into some sauce without even bothering to mix them together. Lastly for breakfast I was served the main dish, a yogurt an a roll. That is alright but I would have wished for some fruit to be served along with it like other airlines do.

Checking prices (two days prior to departure), I noticed that the BC flight LHR-Frankfurt-LHR was only little cheaper than the fare from LHR-Bahrain-LHR on Premium Economy! I rated Value For Money as good, only as I was offered a good price for an upgrade."

If you are flying with a star alliance airline from Vienna airport, during the check in procedure or any concerns still at the airport, you will be served from the Austrian airlines team, which is treating you with not a good customer service. Boarding was really funny as usual when they call first who has priority line, such as business Hon circle and Senator, it´s ending up that also economy class passengers can just queue with them and skip the line, as it was this time. Once in the plane, an A319-100, the welcome was really German and polite from the cabin crew. The seats were nice, actually comfortable with a small but good place also for the legs. As it was just a short, 1h 20 minutes flight of course they passed with some sandwiches and beverages, but they offered you how many beverages you wanted and as I was really hungry I asked the hostess if they had some sandwiches left and after literally two minutes with no hesitation she brought me two sandwiches, with a big smile in the face!

How Lufthansa is a 5 star airline has always baffled me but this time I really got the confirmation. I will not blame them for the 3 hours we spent on the plane before departing on our outwards trip (MUC-MIA), there was heavy snowfall in Munchen and we had to wait for the runways to be cleared and the plane to be deiced. However, during those 3 hours there was no service at all. I wasn't expecting much, but a glass of water would have been nice though. Now, the A380s cabin is seriously outdated. And even though it's clear that the plane we flew on recently underwent a C-check, being repainted in the new livery, the didn't bother retrofitting the cabin, so you get a 10 year old in-flight entertainment system. The touch screen barely works, it's slow to respond and responds only to every 3rd of 4th command. And on the inbound leg (MIA-MUC) the control keys (volume, channel, reading lights) didn't work at all. The IFE also froze and reset several times. On the outbound flight some passengers had the IFE not working at all and although they announced on the PA systems that they reset it several times, it didn't solve the problem. We also landed with the cabin light on (they should have been turned down) due to the same electrical problem. The seats are quite uncomfortable and the pitch in economy is just bearable and there are large metal containers protruding in the leg area. I have flown on low cost airlines which had the same seat pitch. There were no amenity kits provided, which if I'm not mistaken, should be provided by a 5 star airline, even in economy (I have flown on ones that do). The food is also nothing to brag about, it's half decent but certainly expected more from such a prestigious airline. On our backward trip the crew arrived late (but again, not their fault since there was an accident and a traffic jam), however the boarding process was a total mess. People aligned according to their seat numbers, but then they decided to randomly close lanes and just board people wherever. There wasn't even a boarding announcement, just for first and business class. When they started boarding Economy and Economy Premium they just opened two random lanes. This meant that no one really knew what's going on and the random boarding made the boarding time unnecessarily long for such a large plane (people in the back which should have been first ended up waiting for people in the front to sit down, who should have been boarded last). The crew however is pleasant, smiles and does a good job. The pilots also seemed professional and seemed to have everything under control, despite quite rough turbulence at times. At least this time our bags arrived safe, this is a miracle for Lufthansa since they managed to break 2 trolleys on my previous flights. In conclusion, definitely not a 5 star airline and regret choosing them over the other 5 star airline with which I could have flown (despite the fact that my flight time to MIA would have been an hour longer since they operate from a different hub and would have had other connecting flights)."

Security/immigration was quick and efficient. Boarding started on time and was very quick. Blanket and pillow was waiting at the seat and amenity kits were handed out shortly after, as were welcome drinks. Orders from bar were taken prior to take off but dinner orders were only taken after the seat belt sign had been turned off. Despite this dinner was completed in just 90 min after take off. The food was ok but nothing special. The seat, while lacking privacy and not being all aisle access, have to be the most comfortable seats I have ever been in. Whether sitting up, lying down or picking the ""relax"" position the seat was great. The entertainment system was great and easy to use with a good selection of movies and tv shows. Breakfast served prior to landing while ok was perhaps the least tasty meal of this trip. The intention was good but the whole dish had ended up being very dry and boring. The crew were quite non-descriptive as they were going through the motions and while not unfriendly they did not seem to engage at all, a very forgettable crew. Landing in FRA was on time.

The service on board is in line with the expectation, really friendly and regardful. Wi-Fi service costs extra money, even with a business class ticket or for members of Miles&More which is disappointing. starting with 7 EUR just for the slow connection and going up to 29 EUR for the premium one.

Once we arrived at the security check in, the guards further the delay causing us to miss our connecting flight to Nairobi.

We had to leave the secured area to contact personnel to reschedule our flight, which was a night mare in itself. Once at the ""Customer Service"" the agent rebooked us to flight to Heathrow and the onto Nairobi on Kenya Air. We arrived in Nairobi at 05:00 the next morning, having put a very long flight into a much longer flight. The last leg of our flight was from Cape Town to Frankfurt and then on to SFO. Because of the missed flight at the beginning of the trip my sister was unable to check-in online to secure her flight arrangements. After many frustrating calls to your 866 number and talking to someone who English was not understandable, we retired for the evening and called again the next day and finally spoke to someone who helped with confirming our flight and my sister was then able to check-in online. I have no idea what my cellphone fee will be for the call, but this could have been avoided if the error was not made it the first place and when you hirer someone ensure that they speak perfectly clear English.

And attitude. Snowstorm in Europe. Budapest departure delayed. Thus missed connecting LH MUC-DEN flight. Rebooked LH MUC-ORD-DEN. 2-hour wait. Boarded LH MUC-DEN. Told we had to wait at gate for people arriving from Greece. LH MUC-ORD departure thus delayed nearly 2 hours. Long time to sit on the plane. Thus, missed UA ORD-DEN connecton. At LH service desk in ORD, discovered my wife had been booked by MUC LH on LH ORD-LAX, not ORD-DEN. LH ORD told us only choice was to take AA flight next morning to DEN. As that was the only choice that LH offered, we accepted. LH put us up in a distant rather basic hotel. Arrived at AA (Terminal 3) early next morning to check in. Long line. Denied boarding. AA said LH incorrectly booked our AA tickets. We have to go to LH in Terminal 1 to sort it out. Thus missed AA flight. Arrived at LH in Terminal 1 and told they would not open for 8 hours. Went to UA, they tried to help. There was a UA flight at 8.45 to DEN. Why didnt LH book us on that instead of AA. UA called LH to get OK to write the ticket (Hey, Star Alliance, right?). LH agrees but disconnected before transaction completed. UA agent calls again. Starts to tell story, disconnect. Calls again, starts to tell story, disconnect. Finally he is able to tell the story and again request OK to issue ticket. LH says: NO! No? Yes, no. You have to go back to AA (Terminal 3) and ask AA to reissue the ticket to UA. But, wait, there is no valid AA ticket. That is the problem. In any event, if we go back to AA, we will miss the UA flight. So I buy the tickets, and I will ask LH to reimburse. UA prints out receipt and says surely LH will reimburse. After all, if the LH agent in ORD had been paying attention, he would have issued a ticket on UA and not AA in the first place. However, now, LH says no refund. Not even for goodwill. We have received off letters from LH about this. LH says the wait for passengers in MUC, the misbooking of my wife to LAX instead if DEN, the failure by the LH agent in ORD to find to the UA connection to DEN, and the improperly issued AA tickets in ORD were all due to bad weather in Europe. It took us 42 hours to get to DEN. I will try to avoid using LH in the future. The ground staff was incompetent and uncaring.

I spied beer bottles and enquired the price and reached for my wallet. The flight attendant said there was no charge and went on to emphatically say, “I invite you to have a beer” and with that opened a bottle, poured a bit into a plastic cup and placed both bottle and cup on my tray table. In no time we were on the ground, on schedule. A bus was waiting to take us to the terminal. Our dropped off luggage had already been unloaded which we picked up as we got on the bus to reach the terminal. This Lufthansa flight showed how a flying experience can be so routine pleasant. Well done!"

No prior warning about delays, we were all kept in the dark until the very last minute. A 40 minute delay, however by the time everyone had boarded and we were ready to take off, it was an hour and a half later. This meant I would arrive 20 minutes after my connecting flight to Pisa was scheduled to leave, and there was no delay on that flight. In Munich, we were told to go to the Lufthansa service center, there were around 20 desks with only 3 of them occupied for a line of 40-50 people. I was told I could either catch a flight to Frankfurt where I would be put on a waiting list for a flight to Florence, or put in a hotel. As I was in a rush to get away from this airport, I chose to fly to Frankfurt. This flight was delayed by an hour. I did not  receive any food or drink vouchers, except a 60 cent gingerbread cookie. There was no food provided on the flights from Berlin to Munich, and Munich to Frankfurt. To make matters worse, the service was horrendous. When I asked a flight attendant if she could give me some information as to whether my connecting flight would leave on time, she made a joke and said “these delays affect me too as it means I will have to work two hours more today”.  This is the last time I will set foot in a Lufthansa flight."

We talked to airport staff and expressed our concern as our wedding attire was in the luggage and we were having our ceremony the following weekend. After dealing with airport staff we were sent home and told we would be contacted when our luggage arrived. Three days later we were told our bags had showed up but due to customs we would have to drive the 3 hours back to Belgrade to retrieve them. After another day of our trip lost and a few hundred dollars in gas, tolls, and customs fees, we finally had our clothes. When we returned to the US we filed a claim for the hardship and money lost due to their delays. We have been going back and forth for a couple months now with an endless string of emails requesting that we submit more and more documents and receipts and whatnot.

First time my son and I decided to try flying in Premium Economy as we were flying with Lufthansa. In short, it isn't worth the money we spent. It was more comfortable than flying in Economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. Differences between Economy and PE are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of Economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. The kit has 'Cerruti 1861' on it not Lufthansa and was just okay. They serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which I think should be varied. The drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. British Airways and Air France serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. The service was fine. We had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. Food was tasty. However, there are just two choices: Meat dish or pasta. And the portions are as small as a frozen meal. Everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. Bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. The flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. However, the choices were either crackers, Lindt chocolates, and juices and water. Seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. I found it problematic to recline. In fact, I could not figure out how to do so. And the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. If I weren't sitting next to my son I'd need to ask my seat mate if I could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. Worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire PE section and they were filthy. Plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. In fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. Sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. Also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. I've flown British Airways and Air France which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. This was a connecting flight between Munich and Rome. Hated that we were not told that upon arrival in Rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. It was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. Would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. All in all, I'd have to think hard if I want to spend another $2K for Lufthansa's PE in future. I just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in Economy. In fact, they make it known that you're really in Economy as you have no special boarding privileges either; you enter with all of the Economy passengers."

However, this young lady despite the challenges held her resolve and “passed the test” literally speaking. She was not to be rattled by such behaviour. She went about her duties in methodic manner and executed her service in a timely and professional manner. No running back and forth servicing one passenger at a time, or forgetting this or that.

As a 182 tall guy I found the seats to be the most comfortable economy seats I have sat in as my knees didn't touch the seat in front and I could stretch my legs comfortably underneath the seat in front.

The lady at the boarding gate in Munich has looked in the PC, but she was not able to give a conclusive answer. She just gave the advice to ask in Beijing! On my objection that I do not speak Chinese, she said that at the jetway when leaving the plane there are always someone with English language skills. That was not the case. Then, as a precaution, I waited for my suitcase on the luggage belt, which then came. The food of the flight section MUC-PEK can be classified as problematic. The first leg of the return flight, which I took with my wife, was done by Air China. The first leg was delayed by 1:40 hours due to fog in CKG. We had to fear for our connection in Shanghai, because an airport change from Shanghai Hongqiao to Pudong (around 60 km) was necessary. When we made our online booking only a terminal change was indicated for Shanghai. Later it was changed in an airport change. Air China was unable to obtain any assistance because of the delay. Then there was an altercation at the check-in CKG because of the number of luggage (2 pieces each 23 kg per person). Air China wanted to carry only 1 piece with 20 kg/person. Furthermore, it was forgotten to enter the passport number on my wife's boarding pass, as soon as the next trouble occurred at the security checkpoint.

Food was great, but entertainment could be a tad more recent. Flights right on time. MUC LIS leg was overbooked but passangers were offered a rather good option if they chose to fly the following day. One slight detail: transferring within Beijing airport is beyond confusing and Lufthansa should take care of it together with their alliance partner"

The worst experience i have had with the airline in terms of emergency management. Weather was a bit rainy, so they cancelled the flight - almost no other airline did, but ok. Nobody from the staff knew what to do, how to handle the passengers. Took me about two hours to get hold of anyone. Lufthansa hasn't made any attempt at rebooking with another airline - said they tried with their partners (only partners), but those had no seats. Then they planned to book me for the next evening, took a lot of effort to have them book me for the morning - I had a venue to attend as a photographer, which I ended up missing. Then they booked the passengers into some hotel 50 miles from the airport, without providing transportation. Cab cost me 70 EUR each way - which they promised to pay back, but it's been over a month now, and I still haven't heard back - and it's impossible to get hold of anyone responsible for that, operators just tell you ""Oh sorry, hope they get back to you"".

Lots of space, away from galleys and far enough from lavatories. Two things that are inconvenient - the aircraft is extremely noisy and the noise cancelling headphones, attached to seats in Business Class are very bulky and impossible to sleep in. Ear plugs don't help with the noise. I've done this route three times in the past year, and I always choose 8A on MUC - YVR leg. Service is impeccable, food could be hit and miss, entertainment is great and the aircraft is not good, but that's what Lufthansa flies on this route, hence I don't have much choice.

Air Nostrum is a substandard low cost airline, normally operating on behalf of Iberia. Not even a Star Alliance partner. There was zero service onboard. Flight attendants were rude.

Right away contacted Lufthansa Customer Service and after being on phone to get connected for 45 minutes, I requested this is a mistake and very nicely asked them to correct and credit back my money. The customer service agent was very rude and not helpful and said this is a done deal and he cannot do anything. He said I can go to ticket counter and see if they can do any thing. I did write few emails and showed my concern and requested correct of action. At the same time I approached the ticket counter in San Jose and the agent was very nice and after 45 minutes trying to connect to Lufthansa customer service, he apologized that could not get anywhere and asking me to try in Germany’s customer service ticket counter. I did the same thing and the rude agents in Germany by twisting my statement and putting 100 percent blame on me asked me to use the deal or lose everything (meaning lose your money and seats). I told them I preferred not to use the business portion since I can not do anything afterwards. She responded use it or lose it. So you see how I started my trip, with anxiety.

The inflight entertainment system on the trans-Atlantic flights had a decent selection of movies and music, but my screen kept freezing and crashing, and had to be reset, on both long-haul flights. The food on the EWR-FRA segment was okay, but the chicken meal on the FRA-EWR flight was absolutely horrible. Decent bar service on both long-hauls though. The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful. I just barely made it to the gate a few minutes before they closed the doors. My already short connection was made even shorter due to the fact that the flight from Vienna landed what seemed like several miles from the actual terminal, and we were then treated to a 15-minute bus tour of Frankfurt airport, so I ended up literally having to run all the way to my next gate. Overall, I'd still fly LH again, they're still better than any USA-based airline, as well as better than many European ones, but as a supposed 5-star carrier, they really need to improve the food on long-haul flights, work out the glitches in the entertainment system, and take better care of passengers' luggage."

We had a very short layover in Frankfurt and our flight from Lyon to Frankfurt was delayed. The pilot announced several times that the flights from Frankfurt were also delayed and not to worry. Nevertheless, we ran as quickly as possible to make our connection to Philadelphia. The gate agents practically laughed at us and said that flight was long gone. The truth was we arrived at our gate at 1:45pm, the flight was delayed until 2:10pm (according to an email I received from Lufthansa) and did not actually take off until 2:30pm (according to FlightAware). Yet, Lufthansa did nothing to get us on that plane (I assume it was out on the tarmac - the busing around the Frankfurt airport to and from the planes is ridiculous). Instead, we had to go to customer service and were re-booked on a flight the following day. Customer service actually seemed annoyed that they had to deal with us. Then to make matters worse, the customer service rep said they would book us at a nice hotel in center city so we could see Frankfurt. The hotel was no where near center city - we were in some warehouse district that was not walking distance to anything. To get to center city was a walk and two bus rides away or a 40 euro round trip taxi ride. Ridiculous! The extra 24 hours in Frankfurt was awful and I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was seriously the most money I have ever spent on an airline ticket ($1900+ per person) and the worst experience I ever had.

I booked to fly with Lufthansa from London to Zagreb via Frankfurt on a Wednesday evening. The check-in staff told me that the first flight was delayed so I would miss the connection. The impression was this was very much my problem and I should speak to the reservations line. Reservations changed me to a flight via Vienna to stay the night in a hotel courtesy of the airline and fly to Zagreb early the next day. I was satisfied with this. I asked the check-in staff whether I should get the hotel voucher from them or from Vienna airport - they were clear that I should collect this from the Austrian Airlines representative at Vienna airport. On arrival at Vienna I was told by the Austrian Airlines representative that Lufthansa had put no information on their system relating to my needing accommodation for the night. They spent 20 minutes trying to contact Lufthansa reservations and were not able to - on speaking to a representative at the Frankfurt Lufthansa headquarters the Austrian Airlines rep was told ""that's not my responsibility"". There was a pop concert on in Vienna - there were no rooms or only rooms with inflated prices available and I could not afford the cost of a taxi to/from the city and a hotel myself. I approached two hotels in walking distance who told me they had rooms only accessible with a voucher. Austrian Airlines would not provide me with a voucher without Lufthansa indicating on their system that this was agreed. The rep apologised for the experience I was having due to Lufthansa but was  unable to act without their ticking a box on the system.  I spent the night on the floor of the airport.  I emailed Lufthansa that night expressing my frustration and requesting compensation. I have heard nothing back over a week later and just spent 25 minutes waiting on their customer services line without getting through to a representative. "

I sent this note to customer service because of the sweetheart that helped me get home. After a delayed flight from Sofia to Frankfurt, I missed my connection back to Florence which in and of itself would not be a problem if I did not have another flight the very next day from Rome to Bangkok, ironically connecting in Frankfurt again. The flight was not on the same booking as I had taken a last minute trip to Bulgaria and felt comfortable giving myself one day in Florence before my flight back to Bangkok. What would have been a few busy days of traveling quickly turned into a nightmare. After a long walk to terminal B to the transfer counter, which I could not find and was not clearly marked, me and hundreds of other frustrated and tired customers got in line. Standing there I realized that I could potentially miss my return flight to Bangkok the next day because of a one hour delay; my best laid plans were ruined. As I inched forward slowly to the front of the line, I could see the agitated groups of people huffing and puffing about their misfortune. I started to feel a tinge of panic too. Standing in the very front I looked at the flashing number and approached the counter. I was greeted with a welcoming smile and cheerful voice. Already an amazing feat as far as I was concerned seeing the amount of verbal abuse that was going on at the counters while I was waiting. This immediately put me more at ease. I explained my predicament: If the earliest flight from Frankfurt to Florence landed at 9:30, I would not get home to get my other bag and drop off the keys to my friend's apartment until at least 10:30, it's a 30 minute walk to the train station and a taxi is not much quicker then I would have to hope there was a train right away. If my some twist of fate I got an 11:15 train, I'd be at Rome central station at 12:45 and then have to hope again there was a coinciding train to the airport just at that moment which would get me there around 1:30pm for a 2:55pm flight and that is if absolutely everything went my way carrying two pieces of luggage in the hot August sun. Maybe some daredevils think that is plenty of time but I'm a traveler that arrives 3 hours early for every flight. Just thinking about that time frame was causing me stress. The friendly woman behind the counter listened and empathized with a smile. She could have just told me that even though both flights were with Lufthansa because they were on different bookings that there was nothing she could do. She could have politely told me that the 8:30am flight was the best she could do or brushed off my concerns and turned her attention to the hundreds of people behind me. But instead she really took my case as a whole, as a human being with a problem that she could help solve. "

Unfortunately, there is no Lufthansa employee in the entire Lufthansa check-in is area as it is handled by a third party and they could not help me.

I find it disappointing that there is no Lufthansa agent in the check-in area or at the ticket counter at Berlin-Tegel, an airport at which Lufthansa is the biggest airline. So I gave up and went to the Senator Lounge and found Tegels one and only Lufthansa agent on duty there at the entrance: She actually was very helpful but by the time I got there it was too late to change to an earlier flight. The flight itself was on-time because the crew was outstanding: They helped during boarding so that we got off the ground on time.

At the service desk, the employee was helpful and kind. I was giving a voucher for the hotel, dinner, breakfast, and transportation. They put me on the next flight to Toronto for the next day. This helped alleviate my distress and it showed that Lufthansa strived to do right by their customers when a mistake is made. On the flight, the staff and Lufthansa work hard to make the economy not feel like an economy cabin. We were given hot towels twice, headphones, blankets, snacks, drinks, and food. I've been to other airlines and they don't usually give out that much. It makes the flight bearable and quick.

Eventually, I managed to get past the counter via showing the Swedish school’s acceptance letter.

The original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes, which is more than enough. However, the boarding time was delayed twice as I was waiting in Basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. So I asked the front desk what should I do in order to catch my second plane, and she  couldn't give a useful answer, saying you should be able to catch it. As I got on board, I asked the crew several times about whether there is a fast track for transfer and whether they have further information about my second device. All the feedback I got was ""I couldn't give any information"" and ""sorry we don't have the device to check"". By the time I get off the plane, I still have five minutes to catch up. However, I have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. This is simply no way for me to speed up. I ran  but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. So I have to go to the service center for the rebook. But the queue is super long. They only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people.  And the officials didn't even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. This isn't my first experience of a tight transfer so I do have some example to compare. I remember when I took a Swiss airline from Beijing to Zurich, the plane was late due to frost for two hours. However, during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew. And as soon as I arrived at the Zurich airport, there are officials guiding us how to go and the transfer was really fast. Eventually everyone was happy about it. If the connection could just be a little more well organized, they could help me catch up my second flight and help many others."

SQ seats (due to the lower leg support and the foam in the seat itself) is in my opinion more comfy. And the noise cancelling headphones in SQ make a difference.

Upon arriving at DUS to see what alternatives were available as nothing had yet been listed in the LH App and LH disconnected my attempted phone call 5 times whilst in waiting queue, they were most apologetic and had our complimentary replacement ICE High Speed train tickets to Frankfurt printed out and ready to go, along with a time table, within 10mins, which was much appreciated. The LH only check-in located directly upstairs from the FRA airport train station was also handy.

I was going to Prague on a Floorball cup with my team. The plane was over an hour late from Gothenburg, so we were worried not to catch the transfer in Frankfurt. The in-flight service was good, and for such a short flight, it was just the ordinary expected; a snack (consisting of a sandwich with mayonnaise and turkey meatloaf) and a drink. The crew was kind and helpful, they weren't irritated because of the delay and answered our questions. At the Frankfurt hub, the transfer waited for us at the gate, giving it somewhat of a delay, maybe 20 min's or so. The organisation of the hub was average, but the FRA airport is really large, so we had to run several kilometres from the arrival gate to the departure one. There didn't seem to be much organisation either, with gates lying far apart although the nearer gates were vacant. Overall I had a good experience though, even counting the delay. There were Wi-fi, but one had to pay for it, in three different levels of WiFi speed and amount, ranging from approximately 3€ up to 7€.

Being German and a frequent flyer of Lufthansa I am very critical towards this airline. Lufthansa kept improving and catching up the last couple of years though. I think now they did it and my last experience was just outstanding as I flew Munich to Seoul with business class. The plane was a brand new A350-900. A mattress has been provided and a Pyjama that made the flight very comfortable. The entertainment was massively improved: at least twice as much movies and programs have been added to system, that contains interactive maps. Last but not least, and which is most important was the crew. The crew was not only very professional (which is state of the art @ Lufthansa) but attentive. Even though the level of Singapore Airlines or Emirates is not reached yet but the Lufthansa crew kept taking care of the passengers the whole flight. Lufthansa merits the 5 star rating if all flights would have the same level as I experienced during this one. To be improved is the seat though. It is too tight, too inclined and lacks of storage capacities and electronics connections. I heard that Lufthansa is working on that. Looking forward for it."

YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options – vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone LH to ask for the Air Canada booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ."

The food is decent, drinks plentiful, and seats are about as comfortable (uncomfortable) as you would expect. Lots of in-flight entertainment options, which is good. The way back through Munich was a mess. For whatever reason we couldn't check in online. We called and were told we could check in at the airport the next morning at the airport to get our boarding passes, then do the same again once we were in Munich. This went OK for the first short flight, but horrible for the connection. The Lufthansa service desk in Munich wouldn't print our passes and sent us to the gate without alerting anyone. Lufthansa has an extra security check-in before the gate, and those employees didn't want to let us through without a boarding pass. This resulted in about twenty minutes of additional delay with three other confused Lufthansa employees. We finally made it to the gate where we were then reprimanded by another Lufthansa employee for being late for boarding. She refused to sit my husband and I together (?), so we were placed in separate aisles. Once on board the flight, the seat I had been given was in between a woman and her two children. She asked me to move, which I did. The row behind my husband's assigned seat was almost empty, so we ended up sitting there together. Essentially if you enjoy taking care of a bunch of customer service fails yourself, this is a great airline. Personally, I probably wouldn't fly Lufthansa again."

Still, I find the 50-minutes train ride from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt a very convenient alternative compared to flying. What I do not like is that there are no check-in agents at Cologne Station anymore – they have been replaced by a check-in machine. So it is not possible to make changes to the ticket: No change of flights, seats, frequent traveller card or APIS when flying to the US. Security at Frankfurt was very quick and I went directly to the lounge closest to my departure gate in the A terminal (A30). It was a business class lounge and had a really good selection of food and I nice tarmac view. It even had showers (which I did not use). I found it better that the Senator Lounges. The flight from FRA to CPH was fully booked in Economy, so no free middle seat. Nice crew, a bite to eat and two drink services (1h15m flight!). All in all a good experience.

No free internet in the cabin, you need to pay same as a economy passenger. Seats the same and service not so different than the economy cabin. No priority boarding in practice, as they give priority to passengers with kids, which practically means almost half of the cabin so you need to wait in the tunnel to aircraft 10 minutes without A/C.

We were not proactively offered anything (drink, etc) on flight ATH-MUC, the curtain between Business and Economy was left open for most of the flight, with the result that the Business class lavatory was used by people from Economy. None of the cabin crew tried to stop them. Surely one of the benefits of flying a Business class cabin is to have a dedicated bathroom? The boarding process was chaotic - any notion of priority boarding was a joke. On 1 flight by the time we boarded, other passengers had filled the storage space. Since we were seated at seats 2D and 2F, where we had no option but to store everything in the overhead lockers, I believe that someone should have made sure that people on the other rows stored things under the middle (empty) seats. To his credit, the steward very kindly helped us find a solution - no pre-flight drinks were offered, on one flight no menus were offered. We were offered a choice of ""meat"" or ""paella"".

I had 75 minutes until my flight to Shanghai, which should have been plenty of time. I had to transfer from bus gate B to another gate Z within terminal 1 which was fine, it only took a few minutes. But then I got to security where there was a long queue ta “Fast Lane”. I spent 50 minutes as priority customer in the queue waiting to go through security. Only half the security lanes were open causing the long queues. Staff were slow, lazy and rude. I am a frequent Star Alliance Gold traveler and I have never experienced such delays, or incompetence at airport security. LH728 from FRA to PVG Shanghai Pudong. The gate side is much more comfortable and better organized than the check-in in IST. The flight was ready on time for departure and the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile. The cabin cleanliness of the A380 aircraft was satisfactory; seats are comfortable and have generous recline for premium economy. On each seat was a plastic-wrapped blanket; a pair of plastic-wrapped, over-the-ear headphones; and a small pillow. The legroom is comfortable enough for sitting, but not enough for easily climbing over a sleeping seatmate — particularly when the seat in front is reclined. No complaints about the flight conditions and service except the performance of the information/entertainment system as it appears to me that mainly old films are shown."

They gave me a tiny thin blanket and I had to sleep on the cold metal chair which was the only object to sleep at the whole time and had to try to be awake for half of the time to keep my eyes on my baggage, so no one can steal any of my stuff. Its obviously not true that the airport doesn't have any room for passengers who their flight get canceled. I was so frustrated and I had to be at work the next day but what Ive got instead was a very poor customer service reps and no one was around who could be responsible or at least give some solutions!

Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrée selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival. Apparently ""priority"" bag tags have no meaning at LH. 2 flights were 3+ weeks apart, but entertainment was identical in both directions."

One of the worst customer service you will experience. Myself and my 15 month old daughter are traveling from Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. When we reached the airport, they checked in the bag and when they checked the passport, they found that my wife cannot travel as there is a new rule that if you have a layover in Frankfurt, we need a valid schengen visa or a US stamped visa. We told Lufthansa that you never told us anything while booking the tickets or even when i called them to pay for the seat allotment as Lufthansa charges person for getting the bassinet seat (Most other airlines provide it free if you book the flight with infant). Lufthansa just want to get the money from you and never provide any information. The person at the check in counter said it is in our website and i asked him to show it, he went and wandered for 15 minutes and said he lost the sheet which had that information. I checked their website and nothing says about the rule. They mention that if you have two layover within Europe you need schengen visa, but not for a single layover within Frankfurt. And the person in the counter said, if you have booked the ticket through Lufthansa, the customer service should provide me alternate route. So, i called the customer service as i booked the flight through Lufthansa.com. When i called Lufthansa customer service, they told me that they cannot do anything apart from cancelling (which i dont get any refund) or postpone the flight to some other day so that i can go and get schengen visa. I am speaking to them saying getting schengen visa takes days and my wife and daughter has to travel within couple of days. The customer service person said they cannot do anything. So, i went back to the check in counter and the person over there called the supervisor who made a call to customer service of Lufthansa and explained the situation. Lufthansa finally said they can put us in another flight with a huge layover everywhere and also it cost us $1500 more as it is considered as one way flight and we need to pay from our pocket. I have been going through all this mess in the airport and took almost 4 hours with the 15 month old baby sitting in the airport. I decided not to fly with Lufthansa as they treated really really bad and went to Qatar Airways and flew with them, who provided excellent care for the baby and myself. But Lufthansa didnt stop there, they charged me extra for missing the flight and also charged me more as my return flight is with Lufthansa. So, i ended by paying more than $3500 for the entire flight from Detroit to Chennai and my return flight. The person in the check in counter said, they see same scenario everyday (at least 2 people every day). Lufthansa is  making free money from 2 people at just one airport and i am imagining how much money they make from all the airport around the world. They charge people when they knew that they cannot fly and also charge them more whey they miss the flight due to Lufthansa mistake. While booking the ticket, why cannot Lufthansa mention this. Lufthansa mention that you need to have a valid schengen visa is there is multiple layover within Europe. If you can say that, why cannot Lufthansa say that if you don't have a valid US visa or a Schengen visa you cannot have a layover in Frankfurt. Lufthansa just want to get the money out of you and don't care about their customer. Their customer service is the worst i have ever dealt with."

When I purchased the ticket, there were flights with either about 45 minute connection time or about 3.5 hour connection time at Munich / Frankfurt airport. 3.5 hour seemed quite long so I chose connecting flights with 45 minute layover. If Lufthansa sells the tickets, the transfer should be possible. In fact, I had less than 30 minutes to transfer as the boarding for the 2nd flight closed 15 minutes prior to the departure. When my first flight arrived in Munich, I had to run. But there were so many people in the queue to go through the security and then passport control. It would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate! But then I realised from the live departure board that my flight to London has departed. As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me. There was a hotel at the airport, Lufthansa should have arranged a room for me there. They should not sell connecting flights with such unrealistic layover time.

We went to counter. There was long queue. It was approximately 20 flights canceled, due to bad weather. So after 1.5 hour in the queue we have reached counter. Staff was quite rude, they told us to go to another counter in departure area. We went there. There was several times longer queue. Here we spent approximately 5 hours prior to reaching counter. Here staff was more friendly. They put us on waiting list for 8 a.m. flight and give vouchers to hotel. Next morning we have repeated exercise. In boarding area they told us that it is 40 people on waiting list and only two seats, so we have to go back to counter. I ask, is it possible to talk with manager. Answer was quite rude: go to counter and there will be your manager. We run to counter. This time we reach it in 40 minutes. They rebook us on waiting list of 11:50 flight and told us that at noon air dispatchers strike in Italy will start. There I realized that we may reach Florence by some miracle this evening, otherwise we may not get there even till our train to Verona. We decided to change plans and cancel our flights to Florence and from Verona. They told us that we have to go to different counter on second floor. Another hour waiting and we are again in front of window. They told us that here we can only cancel flight, but to start procedure of returning money I have to go to site and feel up some request. They told us that we may get our luggage in half an hour to one hour. Of cause, it took us 2.5 hours to get it. Mean while I feel up that form. It was not from the first attempt that I was able to submit it. To summarize our experience: of cause there could be different circumstances, like weather conditions, strike etc., but it would be good attitude to send manager to each canceled flight area and talk with passengers, figure out their needs, try to find some solutions. Nothing of this was done. In addition to that normal companies did not canceling flights due to temporary weather conditions, just postponing it.

I was seated in row 16, the first row of a mini cabin between club and premium economy, where seats are sold at premium prices. The seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong, not a chance to get comfortable. IFE could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could, so gave up on that. The insult after injury was the main meal: a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo! The German kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. Tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why?

I was travelling Business Class from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then to London with a layover in FRA of 1hr 45min. Boarding at ZAG was done without priority boarding. When landing at FRA the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. Not only no separate bus was used for C class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. When I reached Terminal A I had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates B where my flight for LHR was departing from. I have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within Europe, yet Lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. The queue for the security was one of the longest I have ever seen in my life. As a business class passenger and Star Alliance Gold member I attempted to enter the Fast Track. A lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""No"", despite me showing her my C class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. I asked her three times whether Lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""No"". I waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. When I reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. The Lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. There are not a lot of benefits for business class European flights. People pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that Lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. What should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. I have experienced inconsistent and bad service from Lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that I would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all."

This flight also went very smooth and the food was great. After I landed, I accidentally forgot my iPhone on the plane, but before I had even noticed I left it, the flight attendant came running through the terminal to give it to me, I was amazed. My bag was the first one to come out in the baggage claim, which was very nice. Overall, I would definitely recommend Lufthansa."

Lufthansa asked me to change the flight and rebooked me other flight with economy class. I had no choice but took it. By doing that, I lost the privilege of the services of Premium Economy and reduced flyer program points. I purchased the more expensive Premium Economy ticket with Lufthansa and was downgraded to a less expensive economy class. After the trip, I contacted Lufthansa and they refused any compensation associated with this trip. This is an extremely bad experience with Lufthansa.  It is not worth the money to purchase Premium Economy Class since you spend the money but you may not be able to have the services of Premium Economy Class when there is a delay in flight that is not your fault."

Unfortunately this aircraft was not prepared for Lufthansa Inflight Entertainment like the most aircrafts of Lufhansa, so it was not possible to use the Lufthansa App that provides several entertainment options. I am really disappointed about the seats. The seat was too thin and too short. All Lufthansa singlle aisle aircrafts have this type of seats. This was not a pleasure as the flight take 2 hours and 30 minutes and I had some pain at the lower back area and thigs. I guess for a shorter flight the seat is ok, but for flight of more than 2 hours it can be very unconfotable to sit on such a seat. The menu/food was ok, the tast more bland than nice. I expect more from a 5 star airline, especaially in business class! There was only one choise of coffee, filter coffee. No further coffees available like espresso or cappuccino other airlines offer in business class and same typ of aircraft, single aisle. And the service has been done with foof and beverages trollies, this is fine but at some shorter flights within Europe Lufthansa has a signature service. I just do not understand when the principle when do they offer signature service and when the service is with trollies. However both are good for me.

The veal and asparagus would have presented a challenge if we had been using plastic cutlery, but silverware did the job handily. I remember feeling that the seat was somewhat narrow in the flat-bed configuration, but I promptly dozed off and slept soundly for five hours. I must have been mistaken about the seat. With all the horror stories about lost luggage published here on Skytrax, I was apprehensive about my suitcase double connecting in Newark and Munich, but Lufthansa (and United) did their job and my case arrived promptly and intact. I had made a special request of Lufthansa by mail ahead of the flight. All correspondence was handled courteously and professionally. Many reviewers here tell bitter tales of frustration dealing with the customer service departments of other airlines, but I could not be more pleased with how LH handled my request. I have read a number of comments questioning whether Lufthansa deserves to be on the Skytrax 5 star list. In my experience and opinion it is a well-deserved honor."

Cabin crew introduced herself to me (bad sign) and kindly forewarned me that as I was in seat 1C, there would be a bassinet in front of me, and offered me a choice of seat change. Eventually was in Seat 7D. The A350-900 version 1 by LH has 2 business class cabins, the one most fore is a self-enclosed area bounded by the toilets and galley in the rear, but this area has bassinet fixing positions. The second area is aft of the toilets and galley and separated by a partition from the premium economy section, this area has less seats but you are more likely to be bothered by toilet and galley noise, if that is important. This area does not have bassinet fixing positions. The modern seat was as efficient and high-tech as before, really simple to adjust your seat to achieve a variety of positions including lie flat. Service was more friendly this time, though also with a Germanic reserve (none the worse for that!). Dinner was served shortly after departure, and was pleasant enough fare. Overall cabin ambience was good enough to achieve a fairly comfortable sleep, and awoke for breakfast - which was really not deserving of the term, it was the first time I ever managed not to eat scrambled eggs and cheese at 40,000 feet! The only other slight criticism is that the toilets were quite heavily used in business class and were showing signs of definite disorder by the time we were approaching our destination. Overall, a comfortable and plush flight in the very quite A350, marred only by a couple of small points."

Then when I noticed my partner surname was incorrectly recorded, I was advised by their telephone customer services to cancel and rebook, which I did at an additional cost of £400, but again because it was within the first 24 hours, I should have received a full refund (there are still errors recorded in this second booking). After a few weeks I received only £241 of the £528 in 13 small payments, and still await the balance of £328 some 7 weeks of first booking/cancellation. Despite many phone calls to their customer service operators who all promise me the refund within 5 days it does not arrive, but some have insisted all the money had been paid back, or that the total is less than I say it is, yet they are unable to discuss matters further. One even asked me to submit my bank statement to prove that I was underpaid which I emailed to no avail. They refuse to give me contact details of their Ticketing Section, so I am very frustrated. Their online customer services logging system should reply within ""five days"" but my enquiry about the delay and also my follow-up complaint have only been acknowledged but have never been responded to, despite my weekly emailed prompts to them.

Nobody collected her from the plane in Frankfurt as it was promised by Lufthansa. It took ages for her to find the gate at Frankfurt to Kiev and it was one of the reasons why she missed flight to Kiev. At Frankfurt she had to wait 12 hours before she was given a seat to Kiev. The gate at Frankfurt to Kiev was changed just before the boarding. She arrived to Kiev 12 hours later than expected and wasted the money for her train ticket from Kiev as she missed it too.

In the end, delayed by about 30 mins. Boarding was free-for-all, given the delay, but still relatively pleasant. Business seating on this flight was exactly the same as economy, except for the fact that the centre seat is left empty with a ""seat-filler"", that allows you to ""share"" the empty seat space with your other seating partner as a table-rest. Legroom also felt pretty much the same as economy. There was no IFE, other than ""pay-for-service"" wifi, if you wished. The differentiation is the food, obviously - as we were served a full breakfast on this 2 hour hop, with the food being even better than the business class breakfast served on the long-haul LH flight.

The benefits were obvious, especially when travelling with a little, impatient child - you'll learn to love the fast lane, the lounge (even though the one in PMI is quite disappointing, but it is run by the airport itself and used for every airline), and the priority luggage service (which I never noticed on business trips, as I only had carry-on luggage). We loved the quiet atmosphere in the well booked business class compartment - our daughter had two seats on her own to take a nap almost throughout the entire flight.

I also requested services from the staff and the person assigned to the area pretended not to see or hear the passengers' calls. When I was getting my return flight from Buenos Aires to Tokyo, the flight was canceled and rescheduled, we had to wait around seven hours. Someone from Lufthansa staff in Buenos Aires did not want to inform us about the arrival times to our destination. I was assigned a second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo with only one hour difference, I was not informed that I would travel with another airline and they did not confirm whether I would be given seats with a crib for my baby (I had paid for this seat as flying from Buenos Aires to Tokyo can easily take more than 30 hours). I asked the staff to confirm this information, but she told me that everything was indicated on the ticket, which was not the case since it did not indicate the local time of arrival to Tokyo, so I had to request the information from another staff. Finally, the flight took off later than the scheduled time expected so I was afraid that I could not connect flights on time. In Frankfurt, you can experience some delay while making flight connections. No one from the airline assisted us even though we had less than forty minutes to get to the second flight, due to the flight delay. Luckily, some security from the airport gave us a priority in the security line because otherwise we would not have arrived on time. "

Once they announced  there will be a delay at the arrival and they will give further information about connecting flights. The passenger next to me asked how long the delay will probably be but the stewardess did not know. They also announced a gate as arrival position in MUC which doesn't exist. The seats were good, with enough space even for tall passengers, but  only two lavatories for 180 economy passengers? There was no inflight entertainment. Really poor for a four hour flight. The meal was pretty good and rich but we had to wait 1,5 hours to get our first drink and there was no second beverage round as on the outward flight to TLV.

I regret the decision. The worst feature is the extremely narrow seat. I'm not large but found it to be a tight fit around the shoulders. Also, the seat is on a sideways angle, meaning that it's not a natural position in which to sleep in the bed mode, further complicated by the fact that the footwell is very narrow indeed. This is a 2-2-2 configuration and the seats are far too close to each other and lack any real sense of privacy (nor do they have a privacy screen). I do the same sector frequently and this is by far the worst of the major airlines. The cabin looks great but in practical terms (ie the need to sleep), it is very poor.

Flights were fine. Security at JFK T1 is always disorganized, with pre check sometimes available and often not. This time, there was  a dedicated lane, I got to pass with shoes on, but, at x ray, the officer suddenly insisted “there is no precheck” and sent my bag to be prodded, examined and swabbed. LH owns a quarter of T1 and so would seem to have a at least a quarter of the responsibility to sort out the chronic security mess. The lounge was overcrowded and under catered, worn and unchanged. Pre flight dining is now a standard expectation for C class transatlantic flights, but here for a 10.30 pm departure, the offer is a bowl of canned vegetables, sadly wilting on a steam table, next to Teriyaki chicken. There are also some chicken wraps, just about edible. The wines are basic. Pre flight at TXL is even worse. Mobile boarding passes must be exchanged for paper at the desk - no obvious reason; the lounge is outside security, shabby, with a flair of filth. At 4pm, when you might want a bite to catch up on a missed lunch, catering consists of pretzel and potato salad. The security line is long and slow, inspection excessively manual. When you are on the plane, things improve. The A330 on the route has an F cabin but operates C class only, so the front is partly given away to preferred passengers and partly sold to less preferred ones for Euro 450 per leg. I got an F seat free on the way over and paid for the way back, so had very comfortable flights. Of course the experience is not representative of regular C, which is the 2x2x2 layout.

Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is."

The TLS-FRA flight arrived late, leading to miss the connecting flight to SIN and causing me to spend the night in FRA. These things happen, and as a frequent traveler working in the aerospace industry, I'm more understanding than most. However, I was not impressed at all by the way the situation was handled:  no information was given by the crew about the delay of the TLS-FRA leg. We were just stuck in the aircraft, doors closed, and not moving. After asking multiple times, I was told by the FA it was because of fog in FRA. When I proceeded to claim compensation, the airline told me it was because of French Air Traffic Control Strike. Remembering the chaos in FRA airport that evening, I have a hard time believing that. No staff was available to provide assistance once arrived in FRA airport. All customer service desks were closed, even though it was obvious that there was a big mess in FRA. It was impossible to reach the hotline to check for alternative flights. I stayed online for 2 times 45 mns, before giving up. So I organized my own hotel, transportation and meals, and in line with EU regulation 261/2004, I asked the airline to pay for the expense incurred. It has now been 4 months, and I have yet to receive the funds. I received a reply 6 weeks ago telling me the payment has been made, but it never reached my bank account. Now, customer relations department is just playing dead. On the onboard experience itself, I would say that the crew is professional, but rather cold. Food is edible, but I thought below average of other full service airlines. The major issue lies with FRA airport, where connections are very long: I had to walk 35 mns and take a train to reach the other terminal. Security was very long, with only 2 lines open, and rude staff at every checkpoint (passport control, security, boarding gates). Considering the ticket price, I will not fly with them again, mostly because of FRA airport, and the ""ghost"" customer relations department. I cannot believe they received a 5 star rating."

Outbound flight MUC-ATH (Jan.13th, 2018): I noticed that the Business Class security fast lane at MUC airport was not open. The food in the business lounge at MUC is fine but the same. When boarding the aircraft you used to be addressed by name, not for me. The A321 business cabins have a fixed tray table across the middle seat which is very awkward for sitting down and getting up when you have a window seat. An economy class passenger stowed his hand luggage in the business class overhead compartment. No welcome drink, and announcements in German and English, no Greek.  The onboard choice of meals consisted of two main courses, the one I chose I found inedible. LH always serves freshly baked bread which is nice but for some reason they forgot me so I had to ask for it. After meal, economy class passengers queued to use the business class toilet. Return flight ATH-MUC the lounge at ATH airport nice with  better food than MUC but no toilets. Staff took the trouble to annouce LH departures personally which was a nice touch. At gate, priority boarding was announced but not enforced. This is one of the most annoying problems with LH business class travel and it happens all the time. On the flight, again no announcements in Greek, food markedly better, but disorganised service. They didn´t come around to ask if you wanted any extra drinks after meal service, and some tray tables stayed down into final approach at MUC. All in all, not a five-star experience."

Flying from London to Frankfurt was reasonable though we were very irritated that our seats had been changed. The cabin crew were pleasant. Transiting in Frankfurt was very efficient, with a representative meeting us on the exit of the aircraft and took us to our gate. The queues there were long with first a document check and then general boarding. Not only were we delayed by over 40 minutes but our seats were changed again from row 6 to row 33. To say we were irritated would be an understatement. The flight was extremely full and there was barely space to put our hand luggage. We felt sympathy for the cabin crew as they were clearly exhausted, having to work on Christmas Eve on an evening flight. On our return flight, check-in was super quick but boarding was quite chaotic though relatively speedy in the end. We again had our seats changed but it was to the emergency exit row. We transited at MUC before continuing on to LHR. Nothing pretty remarkable for such a short flight. Overall, Lufthansa do well in terms of seat comfort but the food is quite repetitive. However, they are to be commended for being one of the few airlines to maintain a complimentary onboard service in economy.In addition, whilst the cabin crew are satisfactory, they lack the some hospitality and come across coldly."

On the way back from Atlanta it was an A340, cabin was not clearly seperate from eco class, but seats and food have the same comfort as on the A380. Flight was also on time. The only negative thing was that both flights have been heavily overbooked. On the way to US they announce at the gate that every business class traveller which would downgrade to premium economy would get 800 Euro. So far so good, but actually the rate difference was 900 Euro per way (at least what I got offered). On the way back they offered all passengers at check in which volunteer to fly next day 800 USD.

We connected in Frankfurt from a flight coming from Brussels, disembarking this flight we were met by a driver who took us with a Mercedes to the exit nearest to the First Class Terminal. We had to exit the airport and walk about 200 meters; alternatively we could have used a First Class lounge in the airport but we preferred the First Class Terminal. The First Class Terminalwas a good choice as it is just fabulous. I also had sufficient time to take a shower (accompanied with a First Class Terminal duck). About 20 minutes before departure an agent took us to the Mercedes that drove us directly to the plane. With a dedicated elevator we went up close to the first class entrance of the plane. Seating in the nose of the Boeing 747-8i is very spacious and comfortable. The seat converts into a flat bed and you can raise a privacy screen. Soon after takeoff caviar was served which is one of the highlights of a Lufthansa first class flight. Soon some appetizers were served followed by the main course. There were 4 options for the main course; duck (which I’m not fond of), a beef stew (also not my favourite), a vegetarian option (pappardelle) or fish. Since fish was the only option I was attracted to I took it. The fish was ‘loup de mer’, presentation was rather uninspired and the taste was extremely salt. Luckily the cheese and dessert trolley had some very good options and all was served very professionally by the crew which was one of the best and most dedicated I ever had. Champagnes and wines were not the most well renowned names as with some other airlines but the quality was extremely good and typical for the regions/varieties. Just before landing the crew came to say us goodbye personally. We landed on time in MEX and were welcomed by a Lufthansa representative holding a board with our names. The representative took us directly to the diplomatic passport immigration desks. Next we went to the luggage belt where our HON labelled luggage was already standing in front of the belt. This was really amazing; from getting out of the aeroplane to getting out of the airport with our luggage took us only a couple of minutes. This was the fastest I ever went through immigration.

The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt. This would involve a 3am start and I would have to pay for a hotel. Was told that this couldn't be done but if I turned up for the flight and checked in the change could be made at check-in. Turned up at 04:00 to be told this isn't possible and I have to phone Lufthansa. Made the call and after an hour and 300 EUR I had the earlier flight. Arrived at Frankfurt and began the delays, 2 hours at the gate, then 4 hours sat on the plane as the de-icer was needed, then it was needed again. So arrived after a 23 hour day still to ensure a 4 hour drive home. So, sent an e-mail and letter to Lufthansa giving them my feedback from my first trip with them, the bad customer service and the great cabin crew. Received a call from the customer service team (located in Manila) with an apology and an offer of 600 EUR compensation. Agreed this and felt that Lufthansa had actually listened to me. 2 hours later receive a call to tell me a mistake has been made and the compensation is only 300 EUR - sorry I say, you made an offer which was accepted and I'm not accepting you changing your mind. They told me they would speak to a manager and call me back. Received an e-mail 20 minutes later to tell me my 'request' for compensation had been rejected and a cheque had been issued for the lower amount. So I called the team and over the next four days received a long line of contradictions - 'The manager will speak to you now, the manager went home whilst you were waiting, we will only talk to a lawyer, we cannot let you speak to a member of Lufthansa, we are a call agency'. Tried social media, tried all the numbers to no avail. Will never bother them with my business again."

It was phenomenal. It's probably been about 20 years since I last flew Lufthansa and it is still as efficient and good as I remember. Prior to boarding, LH sends out a link where you can download magazines for your flight. Even though there was no in-flight entertainment such as movies, this was an innovative way of rectifying this issue. Business class in Europe, apart from Turkish, is generally done with economy seating and the middle one kept free. That is pretty much the standard. This A321 was the newer generation with the new sharklets (winglets) and looked brand new, the seats were good but no better than in Economy. The service was excellent. even though the flight was relatively short, just over an hour, we were served smoked salmon, some meat and a dessert which were all delicious.

The first flight from Budapest departed with 20-30 mins of delay. This is ok as delays can occur and the duration was rather short. However, arrival in Munich was also delayed in turn by 20-30 mins. The connection in Munich was known in advance to be short, for which reason it is expected that the airline has foreseen how to manage this flight combination. Instead this connection was managed very poorly. Arrival in Munich airport took place at the gate area K, while the connecting flight (to Venice) was at gate area G. This, according to the screen indication itself, requires 17 mins of transfer time. Upon arrival, I noticed on the screen that the connecting flight was already boarding. After taking the shuttle train (needed for this transfer) and running the rest of the way, I arrived at the gate only to discover that the flight was gone. It seems nobody bothered to advise that there was somebody on the way, and hopefully the plane could wait for a mere 10 mins. Offering a connection implies that it is reasonably managed. In spite of the short connection in this case, it seems the airline makes it even worse by setting flights at different areas and not advising of people in transfer. I would never ask a plane with all passengers to wait for a long time, but I do not believe 10 mins would be an issue for anyone. After the above experience, I went to the service desk for help, where I was told that there is ""fortunately another flight tonight"". That meant at 22:00 vs. the original 15:30 that I missed. To illustrate the staff's further lack of customer service, I was told I am eligible for a voucher since I will spend a long time at the airport. I was given a voucher for 10 euros. After indicating that a 10-euro voucher does not seem exactly a correct response from the airline for the trouble caused, I was told that maybe it was a system error, and after a second check, the staff confirmed that in fact I am eligible for 17 euro. I did not continue the discussion as it would have been a waste of time. The above service gives me an impression that the airline simply does not care. In fact it feels like a joke. In any case, I would have expected a much different treatment for a company with a German origin and reputation. Obviously for the future I will avoid this specific flight connection, but I will also avoid Lufthansa connections in general as well."

One thing I had to complain about (I guess that is more a Berlin TXL problem than LH) is that there were no open check-in counter in Terminal C where this flight departed. I guess it was because usually LH departs Terminal A but there was no space for the 747. There might have been a problem for people with checked-in luggage or people who wanted to check in at the airport. The flight itself was the best I have had so far. The crew was very friendly, the entertainment program was good and they gave everyone a chocolate teddy after landing.

However at the following morning (Sunday 12, November) despite we asked for similar service (a wheelchair), Lufthansa failed totally. We waited about 45 minutes in the Hotel reception, to received a laconic communication from the airline explaining that was ""system failure"" and did not book the service. On the other hand, Lufthansa services and his workers in the airport are in a bad mood. Returning to Panama was an odyssey trying to get information about the process of check-in.

On my last flight from Lisbon to Frankfurt there were 6 people queuing up in the aisle waiting for the lavatory making it almost impossible for business pax to use the lavatories. This for some reason is standard procedure on LH. Another problem I have with them is that the crew uses the overhead bins for their own luggage leaving practically no room for their so called ‘priority customers’ which are seated on rows 1&2. Food quality and quantity is also on the decline. If flying in Europe I try to avoid them and prefer LX and OS which are both owned by LH but have much higher standards.

I did not expect something elegant or sophisticated from Lufthansa, but their service was appalling. The flight was delayed due to ""late arrival of the plane"". Quite worn out plane, not much of a welcome on board, dim light in the cabin did not make me feel bad in the beginning but definitely was not comforting. I do not mind not smiling FA's if the level of service is high. On this flight, I learned for the first time what means lousy service in business class, definitely not expected from 4-star airline. Frugal menu had one appetizer (salad) with no other choices. I chose fish for the main course which was greasy, overly salty and poorly presented. Everything came on the same tray. During the meal, no drink refills were offered (I had regular coke), so I had to ask for a favor. After I asked for the tray to be taken away, FA took it and asked me to throw the tablecloth and serviette on top of the tray. I expected a dessert would have been offered but was wrong. So again I had to ask for one. Not happy with my request, FA asked what I wanted and finally brought a portion of fruits which was placed on the table without any preparation. After such ""feast"" I tried to sleep but the seat was (though full flat) bumpy and extremely narrow even for me (I am a slim person). So the only comfortable position was lying on my side. Finally, I was able to fall asleep but was awaken soon by the noise from the galley where FAs were loudly talking without lowering their voices. About 1 hour before landing I asked for breakfast. It was not served right away, so the seatbelt sign came on. FA told me that now the breakfast could not be served. No single positive emotion during the whole flight. Extremely lousy service is only memorable thing about Lufthansa. My flight back with United (Polaris business class) was a pleasant surprise – frankly, I expected the opposite for these two carriers. Lesson learned: Lufthansa’s business is an awkward decoration of a comfort+ class with a flatbed (though very uncomfortable). Given the price for the ticket (almost 9 thousand US $), I will choose Lufthansa only if there is absolutely no alternative."

The onboard service is above average and the legroom is good. However, I had booked to leave on August 25th. On arrival at Schiphol the flight was canceled. Overbooking on another flight was not possible, everything was full. Other flights to Frankfurt departed that evening. Also on Saturdays there was only place on flights with at least three stops and a journey time which was twice as long as planned. Then only one flight took 2 days (!) Later, which cost me 2 days. Cancellation can happen and the fact that there were no good alternatives was not to blame Lufthansa. Where I can admit that Lufthansa does not wish to pay my claim. They indicate that the flight was canceled by the weather conditions. That's strange if you take into account that this was the only flight that was canceled that night, KLM just left Frankfurt. One could easily leave with a delay of an hour or so. Now, in addition to the lack of working hours, I have to make expenses to get what I am entitled to. So service on board 8.5, handling complaints a 2 - the staff is friendly, average 4.2 so. DUTCH: De service aan boord is bovengemiddeld en de beenruimte is goed. Echter ik had geboekt om op 25 augustus te vertrekken. Bij aankomst op schiphol was de vlucht geannuleerd. Overboeken op een andere vlucht was niet mogelijk, alles zat vol. Andere vluchten naar Frankfurt vertrokken wel die avond. Ook op zaterdag was er enkel plaats op vluchten met minimaal drie stops en een reisduur welke twee keer zo lang was als gepland. Toen maar een vlucht 2 dagen(!) later genomen wat mij 2 dagen werktijd kostte ter plekke. Annuleren kan gebeuren en ook het feit dat men geen goede alternatieven had is Lufthansa niet te verwijten. Waar ik mij wel aan kan ergeren dat Lufthansa niet mijn claim wenst te betalen. Zij geven aan dat de vlucht geannuleerd was door de weercondities. Dat is vreemd als je in ogenschouw neemt dat dit de enigste vlucht was die geannuleerd werd die avond,KLM vertrok gewoon wel naar Frankfurt. Men had dus makkelijk met een vertraging van een uur of zo kunnen vertrekken. Nu moet ik dus naast het gemis van werkuren onkosten maken om te krijgen waar ik recht op heb. Dus service aan boord 8.5 afhandeling klachten een 2 ( de medewerksters is wel vriendelijk), gemiddeld 4.2 dus."

Despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from Munich to Vancouver, our experience was frustrating, flat out disappointing. We could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. Error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online, your name, ticket number etc may be incorrect, and your routing does not match your ticket. Error messages were different every time we tried so you didn’t know what exactly was the reason. We were questioning whether he even had a ticket. Called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 24/7. We had to wait. Tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. Had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly int’l roaming charges for calls. Original gate from ATH-MUN was rather close to our MUN-YVR, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. On arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight. Boarding an A330 MUN-YVR was a disaster. Other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. If you’re a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. Passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it. Safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go. Upon arrival into YVR, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in MUN and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. They were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. Total 40hrs. We wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from Lufthansa. It has been 7 days and still no response. "

When you ask to be accommodated on another flight (like a later flight after a schedule change), Lufthansa provides a bunch of excuses. Their customer service call centres are a waste of time. "

This sounded more or less as a solution, but we were then asked to wait until 5pm to get on the plane.

I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldn’t the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers.

About 2 hours before landing, I asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage, i.e. three empty cups. She said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products (which I know) and she had other guests to care for. She would be back later. I asked when as I was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing, and she said ""soon"". I did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept, just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast, whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. Had a flight with Air Canada from Frankfurt to Calgary three weeks earlier, and they offered beverages much more often, and they also collected garbage. It was my first time that I experienced rude Lufthansa cabin staff, but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during long-distance flights, and they also collect garbage more frequently. Breakfast: only savoury, omelette with roasted bacon and onions. I prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of German breakfast on a flight to Germany with a German airline: some bread, butter, jam, maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. I am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers' wishes, but a choice between a Northern American breakfast and a continental (German) breakfast would have been highly appreciated. Why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner (pasta or chicken)? I still recommend and choose LH for short-distance flights within Europe.

I waited on four different lines in which staff refused to help me, and treated me without courtesy because I could not speak the language. I finally had to get help from a stranger from Dusseldorf who could properly convey what I needed. They lost my luggage, and it was not recovered for four days, a day after the wedding. I had to go to the airport to recover it and was told my lost baggage claim didn't exist and I was blamed for it being mishandled, and when I showed the staff that I had done it properly, they did not apologize to me, they just handed me a feedback card. I filed a feedback form and gotten confirmation that it was received, but it has been three weeks and I haven't heard a word!

Premium Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. Victoria to Vancouver  20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada Jazz used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops; and Munich to Geneva by Air Dolomiti on Embraer E195. Vancouver to Munich on A330-300 aircraft. Air Dolomiti flights had comfortable seating, and featured a couple of different regional Italian wines on each flight. LH Premium Economy seating was 2-3-2 across (instead of 2-4-2 in economy), with an extra four inches of legroom (35-inch pitch). Extra legroom and footrest were welcome but seats were narrower than they ought to have been. Between the window-seat armrests and the fuselage was a 5-cm gap on each side of the plane, and all seats had tray tables in the armrests. The front row of Premium Economy also had IFE screens in the armrests – small screens half the size of those in the other rows. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 1½ hours before landing. The meals seemed to be  regular economy meals – chicken or pasta options for the main meal – except that in Premium Economy they were served on porcelain and serving size may have been slightly larger. IFE was good, although films and TV shows were classified in unexpected categories. Outbound connection from YYJ through YVR is always easy because domestic passengers can remain on the secure airside to international flights without a further security screening at YVR. Connection through MUC was better than a year ago because, although you have to go through passport control entering the Schengen area, no extra security screening was required there either. Likewise on the return trip, no further security screening was required through MUC leaving the Schengen area. When entering Canada at YVR you have to go through Canadian Border Services inspection and collect your baggage but even at that point, for passengers connecting to domestic flights, they provide a dedicated area for onward baggage transfer and a dedicated security checkpoint. Despite connection times of only 1 hour to 1½ hours at YVR and MUC, both my bags arrived with me at the destination. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone AC to ask for the AC booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ."

After waiting in a queue that didn't move for over an hour despite the desks being open (extra personnel arrived later), we got to the desk and the attendant couldn't check us in together and this time, on neither flight. The service was horrible. Currently we are waiting to depart and there is neither personnel nor plane at our gate when we are meant to fly out in 15 minutes with no update on how late the flight is.  The options for in flight entertainment were largely disappointing, even for bilingual passengers. The flight 2 weeks ago from HKG-FRA was 30 minutes late causing us to rush to make our flight from FRA-TXL (Berlin). The onboard and ground staff were unhelpful in trying to fast track us through to our next flight. I have never flown on a long haul flight without the rest of my party.

I phoned Lufthansa reservations and they told me that I was right and that I absolutely did not require a visa for a 1 hour transit and I should try to check in online instead, which I did sucessfully. However, the Swissport staff at the airport still refused to give me a boarding pass and allow me to board the flight. They claimed to have phoned German immigration in Algeria but refused to give the name of the person they had spoken to. Their refusal to check me in led me to miss my flight. They refused to provide anything in writing despite me asking several times. I wasted an enormous amount of time and money getting to Marrakech airport, paying for a hotel there, car rental and reserving accomodation in Istanbul. Lufthansa took my money and then refused to allow me to travel. It appears that buying a Lufthansa ticket is like a lottery ticket - maybe you will get to fly somewhere but maybe you will just be told ""no"" and then the ticket that you paid lots of money for becomes worthless. I recommend avoiding Lufthansa as it appears they don't care about connecting travellers and can leave you stranded at a whim even if you have the right documents for your destination."

Online check-in was easy using the booking code, but there was no option to upgrade. To find that out, I had to go to a service counter in Munich. Flight out of Budapest was late, but staff were apologetic about it. Boarding process in Munich was a bit chaotic, since they did not inform passengers about the pre-boarding document check (which seems redundant, since they are not Customs, and we all already went through customs). Staff on the flight were friendly and attentive. They re-arranged seats for a couple with an infant, so that they could use the bassinet in the first row. The woman who gave up her seat got a voucher to use for duty free. These are really nice touches that show they see their passengers as real people with real needs. Alcohol selection was excellent: sparkling wine, wines, beers, liquors, and cognac for after the meal. The meal was fine. I liked the chicken, and the real cutlery. The entertainment system is worth choosing Lufthansa over other airlines that are offering less for within $200 of the the price. There were hundreds of movies to choose from - from many different cultures. The system was really responsive and quick. The screeN is at least 25% bigger than the ones on Air Canada, and it adjusts to more angles. USB plugs were easily accessible, right beside the screen.

This was my first experience with Lufthansa, products I experienced were Economy on the A319-100 and Premium Economy on A340-300. I opted to fly with LH as they offered both the best price for the overall trip and the most favourable times to work with my journey plans. I had initially planned to fly Economy for the entirety of the journey; however, the additional cost for a premium economy seat was so minor that it made sense to elect for the premium option. I made the booking using the LH website initially, which was fine, but then opted to manage my booking using the mobile app. The app I found to be very cumbersome and slow. It took some navigating to make simple amendments like seat choices or adding API/visa data.  I didn't have hold baggage for this journey so my exposure to ground staff was minimal. The first leg of my journey commenced at BHX. The check in process proceeded without issue; however there was a slight delay with boarding, and we departed 30 minutes late. This made me nervous given that I was meeting a connecting flight, however the cabin crew were friendly, informed us of progress and connection plans at all times. I was seated in 10A, and exit row seat with ample leg room. We were offered a basic snack (marble cake) and a juice/coffee. Service was expedient and pleasant; which is how I would describe all of the flight. After landing at FRA I proceeded to my next flight. Unlike many airlines there aren't many ground perks for flying PE with LH. no lounge access, no priority boarding. The enhanced comfort offered on board however is more than worth the cost. The PE seats on the A340 were akin to retro business class seats. Wide, with built in IFE and tray table, with a foot stand (I was in 10A again). I had an end of aisle seat which meant I was not reclined in to. The catering option offered with PE is the same as economy, served on China and with metal cutlery and a glass. It doesn't sound much but it in fact makes the experience considerably more pleasant. We were allowed use of the business class lavatories which was nice given the economy toilets were a good 15 rows back. The cabin crew overall were friendly and helpful. They seemed cheerful and willing to do as much as they could to enhance your experience. For the flight back I elected to pay to use the IAD Lufthansa BC Lounge. It cost a mere $35 and was worth every penny... however, it lacked some of the comfort and grandure usually associated with lounges. As an economy passenger I wasn't particularly fussed but If I was a BC passenger paying a flexi fare (i.e. a lot of money) I'd have found the lounge to be understaffed, A little untidy, and lacking in food options. The return legs were almost identical to the outbound; same aircraft, same seats, same comfort, friendly crew. The food on this occasion was served in tins, but this can be overlooked. Again the crew offered use of the business class lavatories which I appreciated. Overall my first experiences with Lufthansa were good. A great product, great crews, great service."

The crew, as on most Lufthansa flights, was again exceptional. Always smiling, enganging and caring. In Munich arrival and departure from the very nice satellite terminal in T2. Senator lounge there as well very nice, but food offer did not compare with their LHR lounge. Onwards trip to Barcelona was as good as the flight from LHR. Slept the first half of the flight and upon waking up was immediately asked if I wished to have my dinner, which I gladly accepted. The fare was very competitive and the experience was top class.

Problem is at on line check in where system did not recognise existing Star Alliance passenger information and requested Visa rather than visa waiver meaning that seats can't be reserved and then at the actual check in it's not possible to seat families together. Next problem is at boarding which is total mayhem with economy class trying to board at once resulting in delays and a scramble for overhead locker space. LH take no account of Star Alliance status unless you are booked in First class.

Both outbound legs were uneventful despite an hour delay leaving FRA, arriving 20 minutes behind schedule into PEK. Found the Boeing 747-800 series a tad cramped for such a large aircraft. On the return leg our flight left PEK over two hours late due to only 2 of 3 runways being operational. The captain kept passengers well-informed during the delay as we'd been on the aircraft for quite some time. En route, due to the significant delay we discovered we would miss our connection to DUB. Staff onboard kept everyone informed as many connecting flights would be affected. We did indeed miss the DUB flight but we were put up in an airport hotel overnight in FRA with dinner & breakfast provided. Impressively, we informed of this and the new flight arrangements a number of hours before landing into FRA. The next morning we were flown to Oslo and then onto Dublin with SAS (Star Alliance) as all FRA-DUB flights were fully booked for Easter weekend. The first time flying with Lufthansa and was very impressed with the cabin crew, pilots, checkin staff and gate & rebooking staff as we were a 50-strong school group and they dealt very efficiently and professionally with our concerns around the delay and missed connection. Food was frequent and decent for Economy class and the entertainment system was very good also.

I was travelling as part of a group and so decided to book a seat to be close to friends. I was surprised that on a flight that cost nearly £1000, I would have to pay to choose my seat but I decided it would be worth paying £20 each way per person for myself and a companion to ensure that we sat together (£80 in total). The first issue I had was that the seats we were given on the flight from Frankfurt to Atlanta and the return leg were not the ones I had booked. We ended up on the very rear row of seats but we were at least sat together. On both flights (10 hours) we were served vegetarian food because apparently Lufthansa only offer chicken to those toward the front of those the plane. To make matters worse, I was later offered a hot dog for lunch, because they had run out of pizza. The hot dog was still completely frozen. I didn't make a fuss, I thought that I would get a refund for the seats and that would be the end of it. The flight itself was comfortable and smooth so I wasn't too unhappy until I spoke with Lufthansa customer services. They told me that the seat booking fee is non refundable and that booking a seat only entitles you to that ""type of seat"" and does not mean you will be sat in the seat that you chose when you made the reservation. So ultimately I have paid for a seat that I didn't get, I had the same type of seat as everyone in economy and yet they refuse to give me the £80 back.

The Premium Economy on Lufthansa's B747-800 is strangely squeezed between a mini Economy cabin in the front and the main Economy cabin in the back. There are no separating walls or curtains, which kinds of defeats the ""premium"" feeling (therefore, the 2 dedicated toilets are used by everybody). The seating configuration is 2-4-2 (vs Economy 3-4-3). The seats are wide and recline well, but the foot rest is not well thought out for people over 180cm. The food is basically the same as economy, with an extra dish and served on real china and glasses (but Lufthansa's food offering is good in all classes anyway). Would I book it? Only if the price difference is minimal at booking. Best is to book the cheapest economy and ask for a 299 euro upgrade at checkin or gate in Frankfurt (which is a really good deal on very long flights). Avoid middle/window seats, as it is difficult to get out if your neighbour sleeps. My rating for ""value for money"" is based on the gate upgrade price."

However I got told that I would have to pay another 50€ although the Business Class on those earlier flights was half empty. This brought the fare to more than 750€ for a round trip with 65 minutes flying time. "

My wife and I were seated in 32E/F (middle of centre 4 seating with our backs up against the toilets and galley). There was no way of reclining our seats and very little leg room.

Also with their movement we got our knees whacked. What really gets me is that we paid for what comfort Economy Class offers but this was Sub-Economy standard: we would have had more room to move in an animal crate in the hold. Trying to read or use a laptop was so awkward that we had to give up. The laptop could not be opened more than 45 degrees. We hit some turbulence along the way and were told to buckle up. After a long period of no turbulence my wife had to go to the toilet, as soon as she got into the aisle she was told in a very commanding voice to sit down. This happened again later on when the need was desperate. Still no more turbulence and again ordered to sit down. While this was going on the toilets further up the plane were doing business as usual. Don't the cabin crew care about the health of passengers? "

While I would not describe the food as being superb it was tasty (choice between Indian vegetarian and Western non-veg). The A380-800 is a wonderful and exceptionally quiet aircraft, especially in the front part, where the Premium Economy seats are located. The cabin there also had a more secluded atmosphere. The plane looked very new and was in good condition. The tray could have been cleaned more thoroughly before boarding, though (in Frankfurt as well as in Delhi).

For this flight, Lufthansa uses the standard A380. I sat in seat 11D (middle row) in the upper deck. The first thing you feel in boarding this aircraft is that Lufthansa is efficient, courteous and professional. The cabin is clean if not a bit bland, but overall has a comfortable feel to it. The configuration is a 2-2-2, so the middle row is the best bet, as each seat is an aisle. The seats are comfortable and are lay-flat. My only issue is that the controls for the seat are touch and therefore, if you are resting your arm on the armrest, you seat tends to ""readjust"" itself if you brush against the controls. In the lay flat position, the seats are typical of most airlines as they are not exceedly wide, like Singapore Airlines, and narrow for the footwell. One issue is that your feet land on a ledge on the bulkhead which has only a small divider between your feet and your neighbors. Often during the flight, I was awoken as my seatmate changed position and her feet brushed mine. A minor inconvenience, but for some may be too creepy. The service on the flight was very good, if not at the personal level of some of the Asian competitors. The food was decent, but not exceptional and misses the touches of other airlines like ANA, Singapore or even Austrian. The in-flight entertainment is very good. The TV screens are large, clear and easy to see both in the dark and with the cabin lights on. The screen is operated by touch or a remote. You have a massive amount of choices and they seem to have many of the latest movies. Overall, the flight does what it is advertised to do. It gets you there safely, comfortably and in timely manner. There are no surprises with Lufthansa."

This flight was LH1348 between Frankfurt and Warsaw and although it is a relatively short flight, it is always connected with a long-haul to Frankfurt, so after 10 hours of flight-time, being crammed into coach seats is never welcome. If you have not flown Inter-Europe flights, most airlines do not have a separate business class configuration. They use coach seats and then do not book the middle seat. The service is upgraded in these seats, but you are basically being wedged into coach seats at a business class price. As always, though, with Lufthansa, this flight was friendly and efficient with timely service, a decent meal and no surprises."

If they can combine this with proper snack service, it would be great as not all passengers are into drinking alcohol. A warm bread roll would be a good option.

Consequently my colleague had to return to the service desk to sort out the mix-up. Boarding was smooth and o board the aircraft appeared well kept. Following take off we were offered drinks and then lunch. I was seated in the second row of a very lightly loaded business class. When I told the FA what I wanted for lunch she apologetically said that they had run out of that choice. The meal I settled for was well presented but lacked taste. The dessert was dry and inedible. Wine selection was okay but I would have liked more choice. The seat was reasonably comfortable and allowed me to have two hours of decent sleep. IFE was mediocre with a sparse selection of new releases. The FA serving my side of the aircraft was friendly and courteous. Flight left slightly late but arrived on schedule. This was my second flight in Lufthansa's business class in less than a month and I am starting to think they are cutting corners.

Apart from some minor ""beauty defects"", none of which turned out to be Lufthansa ´s fault, the flight was uneventful and quite pleasant. We spent some time at the ""Sala Pau Casalls"" business lounge which is a total let-down (see my separate review). Boarding was unpleasant because the announcements were totally incomprehensible and the Airport Operator AENA seems to be finnicky about hand baggage sizes. They refused to let me take my trolley bag onboard because, despite the fact that it has the required dimensions, it expands when it is fully packed. They didn´t mind about that at MUC but they do at BCN. My bag was checked in and arrived on the same flight as myself in MUC, so no major disaster, but you have to be aware of the situation. The business class experience on this flight was pretty much the same as on the inbound MUC-BCN flight - friendly and attentive staff, good food and drinks, good legroom etc, but our A321 was older than the A320 on the inbound flight and had a sort of fixed tray table spanning the free middle seat which is unnecessary and uncomfortable. There is no inflight entertainment except via the downloadable LH app, which some people will object to, but I don´t.

Our flight was supposed to leave from Munich's new Terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the Star Alliance Schengen Business Lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Munich right now is going through a phase of Siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didn´t make it to the airport on time"". Funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. During that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside Terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. Boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasn´t forthcoming. Boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off Terminal 1 which LH doesn´t even use. Our A320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. In fact we didn´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. Obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. The flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in Barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. The Lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on European flights is worth the money in my opinion even if LH European business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. But the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean. Flight announcements were sufficient and comprehensible and came in four languages. All in all, I would recommend flying LH business class on European routes, and I would recommend that LH improve their ground services in MUC."

As the flight was delayed this should of been sorted out earlier as there was plenty of time to do so. We had to get a connecting flight which meant it was going to be close whether we made it or not. However when things settled down, and I pressed the assistance button not 1 member of staff showed up, therefore I had to go looking for help. When I finally asked they were less than welcoming with the vaguest of answers about us making our connecting flight. Luckily we made the flight with minutes to spare. We asked for a snack before our inflight meal but nothing was available. Again staff were not helpful and kept offering us drink which was of no us to use and meant we had gone 8 hours with nothing but a sandwich on the last flight.

The Lufthansa return flight ruined an otherwise perfect holiday. Flights were late on both legs of the journey. On the outgoing flight the explanation given was that the crew had arrived late the previous night and had to use up their 12 hour day rest, so the next day flight was delayed. Our return flight was cancelled 40 minutes before scheduled takeoff. Of course no explanations given, but considering that most other flights were departing on schedule it must not have been the weather. We were quickly rebooked to another flight 4 hours later. 30 min before takeoff that flight was delayed by 1.40 hours, so by the time we boarded we had almost 6 hours of delay. The flight did not depart at the newly announced time either, since doors closed more than 40 minutes later and by the time we were airborne it was another hour late. The flight itself was ok and apparently we made up for some of the delay. Little did we know that after landing we would have another hour of delay, this time waiting for our luggage. The crew's bags were delivered earlier but the passengers had to wait until 1.20 am to get their bags, with noone from Lufthansa or the ground handling operator to explain what was going on. So instead of getting home at 6 something p.m. the previous day we got home at almost 2 am on a Monday - not ideal if you have to go to work at 8.00 am (wish I had the ability to delay my start of work for the 12 hours rest, like the Lufthansa crew)."

The departure was delayed due to late arrival of inbound aircraft and further delayed due to late boarding. However, there was no explanation for the reasons of delay or an apology from the cockpit. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept. It was the European business class configuration with the middle seat of economy style seating left vacant. The FA's were friendly and efficient which was the only redeeming feature of this journey. The food was below acceptable for Business Class and a huge letdown for LH.

Extremely miserable experience from business class travel.  Our flight from Chicago was delayed due to some technical problem with the aircraft. Ok, I get it, troubles happen. We had to wait 2 extra hours in a rather miserable United lounge in Chicago. On the aircraft in 2 toilets out of 3 in business, the toilet seat was not holding itself while opened - meaning you have to hold it. When the aircraft was landing some of the next flights were announced to be rebooked, but neither my flight, nor my husband was. Even though there were some flights departing after our flights, we were not announced to be rebooked. When we came out of the plane, there was a service person from Lufthansa answering questions. My husband was guided to the service desk and to me the men standing there said: ""if you run you can catch your flight"". It was 9:30 am and my initial flight LH1444 was boarding at 9:15 in a different zone (we landed to Z zone in FRA airport and my boarding was at B gate). Knowing that FRA is one of the biggest airports in the world I though it may be reasonable to go to the service desk with my husband and ask for a change of the ticket as ""running"" through the airport was not an exactly appealing option for a person with a knee injury. However, when we came to the service desk, there was a man guiding the queue to service desk windows and he also told me that I should run to catch my flight. It was 9:35 AM (as mentioned before, my boarding started at 9:15 AM). So if two people told me I should run I decided to leave my husband who was traveling to Prague and try to catch my flight. The trouble was that few steps later there was a different zone of the airport, then I had to go through train and security check, being out of breath when I finally came to the gate it was 9:50 AM and my flight had already left. The lady at the desk said that she is not willing to help me and I should go back to the service desk and change my ticket. In the lounge, they changed my ticket to 12:40 pm. Same time was the flight time for my husband, but as he was flying to Prague, and me to Moscow, we had to stay in different airport zones and were not able to come to each other. When I was boarding the plane, there was no walkway, but a bus, and they were saying that business goes after families with children to the bus. And the employee on the desk was extremely rude, screaming at business passengers they should wait till all children go the bus first. On the plane, the seats were not even with adjustable head. We had to wait for 45 minutes (plus to 4h flight) for some luggage to be loaded-unloaded and for some passenger to come to the plane. During this extra time of waiting in the aircraft there were no drinks offered. "

Only through the grace of about a billion points was I able to snag a Newark to Dusseldorf reward flight to experience Lufthansa’s renowned First Class on my way to a final destination of Lisbon. I felt somewhat unworthy as I settled myself into my 2A open suite, however, I worked hard to maintain the requisite “I belong here” demeanor, unlike the fellow in front of me who danced in the aisle, champagne flute in hand, celebrating after his boss switched seats with him (boss relocating to Business). The A340-600 First Class cabin was full. I spent the first fifteen minutes sipping champagne, enjoying macadamia nuts, and playing with what seemed like several hundred seating variations from which to choose. Service, food and beverage was for the most part stellar although once it was ‘lights out’, our two attendants did somewhat of a disappearing act, although I’m sure they would have been prompt if I had rang for service. The dinner service was outstanding, caviar first course, followed by a trio of appetizers, lobster main, chocolate dessert, complimented with some excellent tasting wines, and all served course by course on a well-sized and nicely laid out dining table. An after-dinner aperitif coupled with a cappuccino (and a few more sweets thrown in for good measure) concluded a wonderful dining experience. Seats were promptly converted into comfortable looking beds with myself as the only hold-out. With privacy dividers raised, the group settled into a state of individual slumber. I chose to catch up on a few recent-run films through the night. A perfect photo-op of a sunrise appeared much too early, as did the perfectly prepared breakfast offering of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  Finishing my breakfast, I changed back into my streets in the very spacious and clean washroom. There was a noticeable lack of interaction with the flight crew. Except for the obligatory “Willkommen to, Danke für” announcements from the flight deck, nothing else was offered. Perhaps the pilots were feeling miffed with their airline, and working to rule, choosing not to associate with even the first class passengers as has apparently happened in the past. The Lufthansa First Class experience is truly special, and not only the in-flight portion, but the other touches such as personal escort from check-in, past security, and into the lounge, as well as the lounges themselves, the service and amenities offered on either continent. As I left the sanctity of the First Class section, a sense of claustrophobia overwhelmed me and I realized I was turning my nose up at Lufthansa Business Class! And, as I sat in TAP Business on my flight segment to Lisbon, with my all-on-one lunch tray crowding my thirty four inches of pitch, I reflected on how fortunate I was to have experienced the Lufthansa First Class product.

We had to wait for 3 busses to be filled as we were parked on the tarmac, prior to moving to the gate. Upon reaching the gate, we checked with the ground staff available and they told us to rush to the specified gate for our flight. We had to walk there, which we did, along with other passengers. By the time we reached the gate after going through Security, it was 5 minutes to the departure time - we were told that the flight had departed and we had to walk back to the customer service counter from where we had come for additional assistance. They advised us that they had not been intimated that we were on our way to catch the flight (along with 2 other passengers), even though we had our boarding cards. The Lufthansa ground staff insisted that it was the fault of Air Canada as the flight was operated by them.  They said the earliest connecting flight was at 7:00 am the next morning via Delhi. I had to remind them that there was an earlier one LH0760, which they agreed to put us on. They got us the tickets and told us to rush to the terminal to catch the flight before it left. We asked for a cart and were told none was available (we happened to get on the cart which the other 2 passengers who had also missed the flight were given by another ground staff). We had to go through Security again and had issues with the alcohol we had purchased in Toronto.  We requested an upgrade due to our exhaustion and inconvenience, which was refused. We got a call from a customer service representative who told us to contact Air Canada for our issues at they had operated the flight from YYZ to FRA.

Seat 1A in First class. This was a special trip to Northern Italy for Christmas with my extended family and an Aeroplan reward ticket. We left pretty close to on time and they made up time on the way over. As soon as we boarded, I changed into the pyjamas and settled in for the overnight flight. Champagne and macadamias arrived quickly and on the seat was the Rimowa amenity kit. Meal service was delicious from the amuse bouche, caviar, black pepper pasta and I think it was chocolate bread pudding, though I was so full I couldn't. The wonderful champagne, I had the old world red and a lovely port. The crew on board couldn't do enough for us yet it still felt really private with a full cabin. After dinner, they made up the bed with a comfy top and bottom duvet and I got almost 5 hours of sleep. Breakfast was fresh and wonderful, I ate light as I had a 6 hour connection in Frankfurt before flying to Milan. My favourite part of flying first on Lufthansa is the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. This is a separate building with no gates attached. You walk out the main terminal doors and turn left and it's a five minute walk. Take the elevator up and they personally take care of you from then on. You can do this not only as a departing but as an arriving first class passenger too. The whole place is bar, they have a smoking room with, and I don't smoke them but my friends would love the cigars. Shower/bathrooms, private snooze rooms and comfy wing chairs and ottomans to sit and read a book. One of the three bathrooms has not only a shower but a full on soaker tub too. I booked it and read my book until my time came. Lufthansa understands that some of us still love to fly and it's about the experience and the swag. Sitting on the bath tub was another collectible Lufthansa First Class Terminal rubber ducky to add the collection. I had a delicious breakfast in the a la carte restaurant, the mimosas and long espressos were great too. It was Christmas after all and vacation. When time came to board they escorted me downstairs to a waiting limo (they have a fleet of Mercedes, Audi, BMW and Porsche vehicles from sedans to SUV's). They drive you across the tarmac to your next flight. I find it hard to fault Lufthansa these days, I like the whole experience in the air and on the ground. There are rumours that LH will discontinue first from North America, I hope not. I could get where I'm going in a shorter route but I consistently fly the long way round to Europe to experience this kind of service. Kudos to Lufthansa for a wonderful job with people who really care that the customer is happy."

However, there was an entertainment App available, but you need to download it before taking off. It's not available for Windows Phone, and when you get informed about the App, it's too late to install it, as flight mode is required, which to me makes no sense.

My flight to Frankfurt was just a few hours away when I got a text that the other leg of my journey from Frankfurt to Boston had been cancelled. I could not afford to be stranded in Frankfurt and nearing panic and desperate, I managed to book another flight through British Airways which would land me in Boston just a few hours later than the cancelled Lufthansa flight. So seventeen hundred dollars and a lot of heartache later, I finally landed in Boston. The following day, I decided to reach out to Lufthansa customer service to inquire about my refund for my cancelled flight. A curt lady told me that the refund was in process and would take anywhere from a couple of days to a week to go through, but she would not divulge the amount to me. I went ahead and told her that I had spent $1700 to rebook my flight just so I could be back in time for my wife's surgery at which point I was told, and I quote - ""that was your decision and your problem. We are not liable for it"". So, was it my fault that Lufthansa decided to cancel my flight because of the pilot strike which is their own internal problem? And they have had this issue for years; their cabin crew and pilots have gone on impromptu strikes for the past couple of years now and the ones to suffer are the gullible passengers. Lufthansa reported recorded profits this year and it is not hard to imagine where most of that money came from: their gullible customers who they so merrily swindle at every opportunity. The only reason that I have posted this review is that I do not want another person to go through what me (and probably thousands of others) have suffered at the hands of this inconsiderate and greedy airline. I would dearly suggest to you that if you are booking your flight at least a month in advance, you are better off going with a more stable airline, as Lufthansa is very unpredictable and can cancel flights and leave passengers stranded with no recourse whatsoever.

The return flight was quite different, it started with Lufthansa canceling our flights on one date and telling us we would have to leave a day earlier or a day later the problem was I would either have to pay for an additional day which was not available - so I opted to leave a day early which meant I was out a days room rent, which is not cheap. We were also bought our tickets 6 months in advance and paid extra for seats in the front of the plane. On the flights they put us on we were in the back of the plane, telling us it didn't matter that we paid for advanced seating, that only meant you were paying for window or aisle - really - we paid $180.00 extra for a window or aisle seat.

The plane from FRA to PTY also departed on time. Throughout the whole flight crew was present and did their best to make us feel as comfy as possible.

I booked Premium Economy as I usually do on other airlines where available. Overall, I thought that whilst the flight was comfortable and reasonable value, the Lufthansa Premium Economy was not as good as other airlines that I have used. There was just a few rows within the Economy class and the only thing to differentiate Premium Economy from Economy was the seats and legroom (which were fine I might add). The food was the same as Economy (very average both ways even by Economy standards although printed on a different Premium Economy menu), shared the same stewards on board and at check-in and boarding there was no separate boarding queue for Premium Economy. Whilst these are not big issues at all I do feel that for paying twice the airfare they might have offered slightly more to differentiate it from Economy.

Initially I had a whole row of four to myself, but before takeoff a man moved, and sat in the other second seat in, so I ended up with just one empty seat beside me, which was still nice. Service was prompt, professional and friendly. I always order a special meal on long flights, in order to get served first. Not because I'm greedy, but that way you are finished first and can use the still clean bathrooms and get settled to sleep before the lineups for the bathrooms start. Special meals are always a mystery, but this time I had ordered Asian Vegetarian, and it was really tasty; and I was very pleased. A delicious veg curry, plenty of fruit, some really good bread and cheese. Plenty juice and water offered throughout the flight, plus a weird tasting cookie at one point.

Music and newspapers were plenty, though. We had the seats in front of the emergency exit rows on the A321. The seats were good for economy class seats, although they did not recline (minor issue with economy seats in my opinion, since they do not recline far anyway) and were a bit less wide compared to the other seats. However, these are one of the few seats in a pair arrangement on the singe-aisle A321. Seat pitch was sufficient, and I assume the extra-thin new economy seats of Lufthansa give about one inch of additional legroom. Cabin a bit too noisy for my taste.

They argued that I missed the 1st segment (the bus) and when I complained that this is only a bus, they said that they treat the bus the same as the plane (keep this in mind).  They wanted me to buy a new ticket, because my ticket was not rebookable and then see when I would fly! After much grief, they allowed to board; fortunately there was 1 seat, but warned me to call LH as soon as I got to ATH.

A few more complaints - boarding in FRA was pretty disorganized and slow becuase the automatic machines were out of order and no priority was given to PE passengers. On the final leg from MUC to Milan, they displayed 1h delay on the screens so I went for breakfast: when I was done I realized that they had moved it back to its original schedule so I rushed to the gate to find out they had just started to board.

Also, unlike United, after they serve you a drink and your meal they don't disappear in the galley behinda curtain to consult their bid sheets. They come around every 1/2 hour or so with a tray of orange juice and water and don't scowl when you go to the galley for another drink. They do everything right."

The A340 is a very comfortable aircraft with a nice feature: the bathrooms are downstairs. We landed 45 minutes earlier, and the transfer was easy.

Two of the four meals were left, and one order of chicken turned out to be salmon, when pointed out they apologised but said all the chicken had gone so the only option was the economy meal or veggie.

One of the worst business class cabins I've flown - seats are narrow and tight, if you do not get a window seat there's no storage space at all for anything (window seats come with additional storage space along the fuselage) so every time you have to get up and reach the overhead bin. Film selection is so-so, the only positive side are the noise cancelling headphones. Food was average at best, service was mixed - the flight attendant taking care of my section was great, smiling, friendly and speaking English. I've noticed that on numerous Lufthansa flights that cabin crew first of all has this cold business attitude and tends to speak German, even if you speak to them in English. The second leg was ok, with a typical short haul flight seat, space and service - nothing special worth mentioning. At that point I would also suggest to avoid travelling through Frankfurt as this airport is a disgrace with rude and puzzled personnel and long waiting lines. The only bright point is the Lufthansa Welcome Lounge with extremely nice and helpful staff. Overall I would not recommend, next time I will fly with Swiss which is way better.

The not so nice thing about Lufthansa is that being tight can quickly turn into being uptight with little wiggle room if a certain degree of flexibility is required. I was almost refused boarding because my return flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was booked for a date which happened to be beyond the extent of my 90 day visa-free stay period in the country. I understand that airlines have to adhere to the rules as stipulated by immigration laws, but ultimately the decision to allow me to board the flight rested with Lufthansa’s flight manager who proved to be stubborn and neither susceptible to reasoning nor my explanation that I was not intending to spend the 5 months in Singapore but would travel in the wider region. It took almost an hour of arguing back and forth with several Lufthansa representatives before I was finally issued a boarding pass.

Boarding announcements at gate 18 LHR T2 were unintelligible so that worked well for me as I sauntered up to the gate before others realised that boarding was called. Quite simply the friendliest crew I have encountered in a long time. Just after take-off a breakfast was offered of cake, cheese or salami sandwich.

The connection in FRA is laborious and involves lots of walking. I took a leisurely stroll directly from my arriving flight to the gate (stopping for a little shopping for around 10 minutes) and altogether it took almost an hour to navigate through the airport, the mono-rail, the security checks, the other security checks and then to the gate. That said, when I arrived at the gate, boarding had just been called so the timing was, in fact perfect. I am impressed with the number of people on the ground to assist you with the transit. It seems there are no end of red-jacketed people to see that you go in the right direction. The crew were very welcoming and bright. Before take off a welcome drink of minty orange juice was offered in plastic wine-style glasses. After take off menu cards were distributed and pre-dinner drinks offered. They commenced with the meal service a little while later but had to abandon it due to turbulence. A helpful announcement was made, apologising for the delay. Two choices of main course were offered which were served on china and with metal cutlery. Red or white wine was offered from a full size bottle with water (sparkling or still). I have a little gripe with the way the service is ordered as I have noticed that on every flight a refill of wine is not offered until just before the coffee service. I would like to be offered a second glass of wine with my meal. After coffee (quite a long while after) after-dinner drinks (Cognac or Baileys). I asked for a refill of coffee at this point – it came about 10 mins later. A chocolate was also offered. Prior to landing in Jeddah (refuelling and crew change) a small half-sandwich was offered (no choice) and this was followed by a glass of orange juice served from a tray. Another gripe is that there is no tidy-up of the cabin during the re-fuelling stop. There were vast numbers of strewn blankets, discarded cups and every conceivable wrapper strewn all across the cabin and they remained there for the rest of the flight to Addis. I don’t really understand why either the departing crew don’t do a once-over, or a cleaning crew pop on board to do a quick tidy while we were on the ground. Overall, I like the LH PE service. I do not have other PE products to compare it with, but for me, it does what it says on the tin. Gives that little bit more attention and comfort to the economy traveller. Very well worth the extra cost."

Every thing on both flights went like clockwork with true German efficiency just like Aldi but with Waitrose quality. The food was handed out quickly but politely and the real clincher was the rubbish was collected at just the right time so as not to leave you with the tray down for ages. Even my grandchildren at 11 and 12 travelling with us were impressed. So on our many trips planned to Malta it's Lufthansa or bust, cost won't come into it but will allow at least 2 hours for transfer as can't gallop these days at over 60.

I've been flying with Lufthansa before, and I am not usually bothered by their service in general. But this time, I decided to request diabetic food.  I have always been afraid of diabetes meals, since they are usually tasteless and disappointing. Whatever that was, it was by no means a diabetic meal, no matter the DB they may print on the coverage. Specifically, the flights leaving Frankfurt. I've attached the photo of a meal. A plate full of carbohydrates (potatoes) and that is it. The onboard crew was very attentive and understanding, and provided me with other option of normal food they had available and that was much more like DB meal, for me. So, besides the supposed DB meal I have no complains at all. I would recommend the airline with caution for that point. So, if you are diabetic and will fly with Lufthansa, don't even bother asking for special meal."

Being served last and not having a choice of meal is something I do not care about. I was pretty close to the galley and could hear FA's chatting/giggling very loudly for most of the flight, and they should have cared a bit more. Most of them were quite cold and they were not serving drinks enough. The seats weren't comfortable, and once the front seat reclines it feels way too cramped, I was surprised it could be reclined that much. Sit back and enjoy the Lufthansa entertainment programme is more like sit back and enjoy your own device.

The service was not good for Lufthansa. For example, one half of the section of the plane where I was sitting (at the back) received meal menus, but not the other half. The meals were reasonable, but the seat was narrow and the meal trays so small that it was difficult for me to eat without spilling anything. And the staff kept bumping the meal trolleys against my elbows as they passed. The plane was one of Lufthansa's new 747s and I expected the seats to be wider and more comfortable. The other segments of the flight were better. The flight from Amsterdam to Frankfurt was very smooth and the cabin crew combined great efficiency with being pleasant also. The cabin crew on the Tokyo flight seemed less efficient and depended where you were seated. The flight from Haneda to Hiroshima  was a 787 operated by ANA.

The seat comfort is a mayor plus compared to the standard Economy Class. Nowadays there are so many Premium Economy or Economy Plus concepts that you don't know what to expect. Lufthansa has done a great job. It's an almost independent class with very comfy seats. The seat offers 18 cm more legroom, is wider and has a relatively big tray table (comparable to that one in Business Class), power sockets and IFE on high definition touch screens. The service was very professional, friendly and efficent. The purser of this flight welcomed us personally. On this A340 the Premium Economy consists of only 19 seats and has it's own compartment. It is quiet and you can deboard quickly after arrival. The food is almost the same than in Economy Class, but served on china and with a menu and some real glasses. After boarding you get a non-alcoholic juice cocktail. Food quality and quantity was fine. You get plenty of drinks. IFE and WIFI worked also really good. At your seat there is a water bottle and nice amenity kit. The flight was almost one hour ahead of schedule. It was a great experience. If the price difference is not too big, compared to Economy, I would not hesitate to fly this class again."

We departed more or less on time, something of a minor miracle at Frankfurt where you frequently feel that you've driven halfway to your destination before you reach the runway. We were upstairs on the A380 which was pleasant. The upstairs economy cabin is relatively small (only 40 or so seats) and feels quiet and relaxed. The seats were OK, not the best legroom and a touch on the narrow side, but not too bad. I would certainly recommend trying to get seats upstairs on the A380. The entertainment system worked well with a reasonable choice. The food was dreadful - other airlines manage to serve meals that taste of something, it's about time that Lufthansa managed to do the same. All in all, not bad, but sadly let down by the food."

The food was much better than expected - on the leg from Munich to Shanghai, the menu featured a dish from the chef at the Pudong Shangri-La, one of Shanghai's top hotels. I also enjoyed the snack sandwiches and chocolates. Service from the flight attendants was very professional and standard. In-flight entertainment was sufficiently current. Nice new airplane with a separate lower floor for the bathrooms, limiting line ups and waiting passengers in the aisles. My only complaint was the seating: The legroom was quite cramped - my knees touched the seat in front of me if I reclined, and I am only 165cm. The padding on the seating was also a bit thin, and I could feel the seam stitching on the seat through my clothing. Everything else was good, and I definitely think that the value paid for this particular trip was worth it.

The seat is indeed comfortable and well cushioned and even for a 12,5 hrs flight the comfort and room offered is sufficient. Especially the cabin on the A380 is nice as it feels more private due to the separation from the main economy cabin. I had ordered a special asian vegetarian meal which was very tasty. The crew was attentive, chatty and smiling. They go the extra mile and make one feel very welcome.

When booking online, by mistake I booked the return flight not one month later, but one year later. When I noticed the error I immediately contacted LH, but due to office closure hours etc. was only able to actually speak to someone more than 24 hrs after booking and was then told that I could only correct the return flight by paying an additional EUR65 change fee per Person (and additional cost as the corrected return date would only be available at an even higher tariff) – the ticket price per person for this less than 1hr flight would have reached astronomical heights of more than EUR 400 per Person. The only other option would be to file an online complaint (they don’t take complaints by phone) asking for a waiver of the change fee. I went down that option and now one month later I still have not received any reply from them, seemingly they just have too many complaints. The flight was as good or bad as any low cost carrier, chaotic boarding in FRA, no room for hand luggage, seat pitch seems rather cramped and not exactly friendly service.

Also that they could either take the luggage or the passengers.  However, it went from bad to worse as it has been 2 days and my luggage still hasn't arrived. Well, it did - at 1am this morning but was taken away when nobody answered the door. How very selfish of me not cooperating with the courier for being awake at 1am following a long haul flight.

They outsourced this task to an appalling company that even they can not contact as they never pick the phone up or respond to emails.

He said that restaurants are open whole night there but that wasn't true and only 1 shop was working. On the flight back a flight attendant was rude, another one forgot we asked for tea.

Like the new business class cabin of Lufthansa very much. Find the seats very comfy and like the colour scheme. Was greeted by a friendly flight attendant on entering the aircraft. Shortly after that greeted by name by the purser. Welcome drink was served by your 'new' personal flight attendant. On this route LH has introduced the enhanced restaurant service. Guess it is a very nice new touch but it didn't work out at all on this flight. Seemed like it was the first time for the team as the purser kept telling them what to do and they seemed pretty overwhelmed with the additional work. Overwhelmed and stressed with a warm smile though. The restaurant service will probably be a nice addition once the crews are trained. Other than that it was another great flight experience. Have been a Senator with Lufthansa for almost 15 years. After some years if downgrading I am very happy to see how much they have improved their entire product. Also entertainment offered a wide choice of current blockbusters. Only minor complaintn is still the quality of the catering.

Onboard the A380 the premium economy cabin is separated from economy cabin which is very nice and creates a more exclusive touch. Food is the same like economy but served on china, which adds quality to the catering. Cabin was full but didn't feel cramped. Find Premium economy a great alternative to business if the fare is good. Had a good 8 hrs sleep and arrived well rested. Would recommend.

The advantages are only more space and more attention from the cabin crews on what you need during the flight (such as more foods/beverages, add blanket). The meal was OK. I had pre-ordered a meal, but the cabin crew did not notice it. Thus I had to ask and wait my meal. The seat was good and comfortable. I could recline it much more to the back. For the value of money, upgarde to premium economy for long route (more than 10 hours flight) is worth. The flight entertainment was not spectacular and contains old movies.

Negatives - We were supposed to board at 12.30 and depart at 13.20. By 13.00 there was no boarding call and no communication from the ground staff at all. Boarding completed about 30 minutes late, we taxied for a while and then the pilot parked and turned off the engines, no communication for 20 minutes to explain what was happening. Waited 3.5 hours on the ground with almost no communication. The crew only came though the cabin two times during the 3.5 hour wait, once with water and once with crackers. Everyone was starving since they had been expecting to get lunch right after take off and was very aggravated by the lack of any service, not even a juice was offered. The kids lunch served (at 6pm) was 5 slices of potato cooked in ketchup with shrimp salad, terrible and neither kid could stomach it. During the flight the crew only came though with water twice on the whole 10 hours. Dinner was either shrimp or mushroom, not something many people would like."

Pleasantly surprised with Lufthansa for this trip. I had been regretting booking with them following the recent strikes, but thankfully this was resolved a couple of weeks before our trip. Planes clean and tidy, all crew pleasant and a small snack of half a sandwich and one round of drinks served on each flight. Definitely worth the small extra price over the low cost carrier on this route. The only issue for us was the 45 minute transfer in Frankfurt wasn’t enough, we parked remotely and were taken by bus to the terminal which took a surprising amount of time, we then had to clear security again and run to the gate just making the flight. The gate agent was just closing the flight and said she was surprised that we had made it. If this was the case why did Lufthansa book us such a short connection?"

Overall the trip was good and LH has definitely improved their C class product. The outbound flight was a little bit of a mess. 3 hour ground delay in DEN due to snowstorm and de-icing. I understand these things are out of the control of the airline but given that 95% of the passengers were making connections in FRA they could have done a better job of holding flights/rebooking. Arrived FRA and ran to BLR flight and arrived 5 min before scheduled departure to be told my seat was given away. I was unimpressed given that they knew for hours that connections would not be made and they could have held the flight. Gate agent unhelpful so went to Senator lounge where I was immediately booked to DEL. Lounge staff very helpful. Inflight was impressed with all crews, very attentive particularly on the FRA-India legs (which is not usually the case). Food has improved and inflight entertainment good. 747-8 is a nice aircraft, hopefully they will introduce on the whole network. Ground staff could use some work."

Our flight with Lufthansa from Chicago to Frankfurt was a wonderful experience. I have previously flown on a Lufthansa 747-400, and the 747-8 is a huge improvement! Much quieter, noticeably larger windows, and the economy seats are an improvement. The A319 is nothing special there, but great for an hour and a half flight. Service was great during the flights. The flight attendants were very accommodating for us, as we were flying with children. But, unlike some airlines I’ve flown with (ie. Qatar Airways) the staff didn’t really go out of their way to make it comfortable for the kids. As for meals, I would rate them in the top 3 of airlines I’ve flown with. Also, the IFE was one of the best I’ve experienced, with many options for children’s movies. The staff in the airports were equally as helpful. Overall, a great airline, with professional staff, and nice airplanes."

As a loyal customer I appreciate that very much. Even though I have been very satisfied with the service provided on most of my flights within the past few years one has to acknowledge that this last flight was my best flying experience ever. The new Boeing 747-800 is a wondeful aircraft to travel in, new business class is very comfortable and the seats lovely in any position, the inflight entertainement offerd a great variety; but what made the experience superior to any other before was the outstanding crew.

On my way back, there was a technical glitch with the engine and my flight got delayed by 9 hours. As a result, I missed my connecting flight (With Thai Airways) and was forced to stopover in Bangkok for 10 hours. However, the worst part was the customer service at Frankfurt First Class counter which is where I was directed to, to get further help. It proved to be anything but, helpful. I asked the person at the counter, that due to this delay, now I would not only miss my connections but, also have to stay overnight in Bangkok for 10 hours - how would Lufthansa assist. I was informed that my Contract with Lufthansa ended in Bangkok as my connection was booked separately with Thai Airways and not through Lufthansa.  I had  to go to customer service online or look for Thai Airways staff in Bangkok. When I tried to explain to him that it is basic courtesy that he or someone in Frankfurt office communicates this to their Bangkok office in advance, so I don’t have to go looking for their representative at midnight after a long flight, I was informed this is not possible as they had given me an airport hotel voucher in Frankfurt for the delay and had met their obligation and their contract ended the moment I landed in Bangkok. I re-iterated that all I wanted was that they communicate to their team at the other end, so whatever solution they have can be pre-planned, as it was Lufthansa fault. However, it proved too difficult for the counter person to comprehend, and I had to ask for his supervisor, who seemed to understand and agreed to inform their Bangkok team.  I could not comprehend the service standards and I could not escape the feeling that they were doing me a favor. I understand delays happen, technical glitches happen but, the manner in which you deal with your customers under such circumstances shows the quality of any airline. Lufthansa failed in this case."

Swift check-in, passport check and security, all very pleasant. We decided on the Thai Royal Orchid lounge as opposed to the United Airlines option. Lounge not too busy, varied choice of food. I had dim sum and spicy soup, sandwiches and a glass of white wine. Sadly there is no champagne in the Thai lounge at HKG nor any choice of wine other than red or white. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the experience and the gate was not too far away. Boarding was orderly, despite the best efforts of some passengers who clearly didn't understand the logistics involved in boarding the A380. We were amongst the first to board and received a warm welcome from the cabin crew and we were addressed by name during the service. Pre-take off drinks were offered including sparkling wine and an amenity kit, slippers and a bottle of water were in the seat pocket. After take off drinks included champagne with a smile and the dinner service was excellent, the scallops and chicken with rice dish was very tasty and the crew were charming. Dinner was rounded off with cheese and port and then coffee and a rather nice Cognac. The seat when fully reclined was comfortable and felt more roomy than the Swiss seat/bed I had on the outbound and I managed to sleep for a few hours undisturbed. The cabin on the A380 was noticeably quiet, maybe because Business class is upstairs. A hearty hot breakfast was served which was tasty and ample. An excellent flight with a stellar crew. Quick disembarkation at FRA and we made our way to the quiet Senator lounge prior to our, not cancelled flight to London City. The flight was very full because many of the mainline flights to Heathrow were cancelled. This short flight was another enjoyable one with a personable crew and a quite filling continental breakfast of cold cuts, cheese, fruit and pastries. The usual bus to the terminal but at least there were the e-gates so not much waiting at immigration and our bags were waiting for us on the carousel. Another excellent Lufthansa experience."

We enjoyed our trip, as it was an overnight flight the babies sleep for most of the time - and thankfully did not disturb other passengers. The only point is the Baby changer in the bathroom, it is rather difficult (for a man) to change the diapers on the changing table. The service onboard is fantastic - very professional.

The seatpitch was around 31-32 inches but the seat cushion was quite thin. The cabin crew were very friendly as usual for Lufthansa and very professional. The meals that they served on this flight from YUL to FRA were rather standard airline food. We arrived on time in Frankfurt without any problems.

Later, when I went to fly out there was a problem with my layover not having enough time to get my checked bag through customs and still make my flight.

My first time on Lufthansa Premium Economy, loved the extra space, and must say the Lufthansa meals have improved, the curry dish for dinner was excellent, and the fruit salad served with breakfast was as answer to my prayers - the supply of wine at dinner time and coffee at breakfast is still on the meagre side. Seats comfortable, service great, pity the toilets for economy are at the front of the premium economy cabin, giving a lot of traffic. Also, they seem too few, so queues build up after diner and before breakfast and landing, crowding the cabin and making it busy. After a shower and fast breakfast in the business class lounge in FRA on to BCN, normal economy seat, some coffee and bun - nothing special, dozed. Did not mark the WiFi as I do not carry any devices that need to connect, internet connectivity was advertised on the flight - I just need peace and tranquillity, disconnecting is a plus.

However, when my mother arrived in Frankfurt for transfer to Singapore, there was nobody to pick her up at the gate so she had to walk all the way to the next gate. For those who have been to Frankfurt airport you know that this can be a considerable distance. Upon her arrival in Singapore I called Lufthansa to file a complaint and was met with the instruction to do this via the website. I did that and got an automatic reply. Since then (now 14 days ago) I have heard nothing from Lufthansa. On her departure from Singapore I was guaranteed that my mother would have access to the business class lounge in Frankfurt on her transfer back to Karlstad as a compensation for their mistake on her outbound journey. (The thing is that there is no business class on the flight from Frankfurt to Karlstad so even though I booked a business class ticket I couldn't get any on that leg). On arrival in Frankfurt she was denied entry to the business class lounge and was put in a wheelchair in a corridor far away from the cafe to wait there for 2.5 hours.

My tired toddler made me stand through out the flight. While returning (Delhi-Frankfurt), again service was poor, whereas it was nice from Frankfurt to Dallas. Is this limited service common for south asian flights. Flights are usually full, so there is a little chance to change seats. Air-conditioning in flight can give you a hard time and square cut blankets will not help you, better carry your own 1 light weight blanket and cap/hat and socks.

I do have two items to comment on: the selection and quality of the food served, and the discomfort of the headphones. The selection and quality of food was terrible.  Food was inadequately seasoned, no balance between protein, vegetables and starches, and the salad was a joke (a few scraggly strips of lettuce with no veggies at all). The rolls served were ice-cold. Not a pleasant dining experience. The second item was the discomfort in wearing the headphones for the in-flight entertainment. The plastic earpieces were incredibly uncomfortable and the flimsy pads weren't anywhere near sufficient to reduce the discomfort. If we had been on a short flight, I could overlooks these drawbacks, but we were on a 10-11 hr flight, and these things made the overall experience less than ideal. "

Our flight from Budapest to Munich was quick, we were provided a full lunch and flight attendants were efficient in moving through the cabin quick so that trips to the washrooms would be possible for everyone before descent. The flight from Munich to Newark was on one of Lufthansa's A340-600s (my first time on an A340) which I must say are absolutely stellar even compared to the A330 which has pretty much the same cabin. The fact that all economy class washrooms are on the cargo level of the aircraft make it very easy to get to them even if it's the middle of dinner service. The seats were extremely comfortable and the IFE system packed with good content. The flight attendants were professional and went out of their way to make everyone comfortable. Despite taking off from Munich 50 minutes late due to delayed incoming passengers from other flights the pilots did a good job at making up for time and we arrived almost on time in Newark. This was my third time travelling with Lufthansa and they never disappoint."

Only small negative point: No amenities are provided and Wifi was not for free. Lufthansa product is not as fancy as Turkish Airlines or Emirates but the staff is amazing. "

We booked and paid for extra legroom 12E/F on an A320. This was done using their layout layout of the A320. On arrival at MAN and prior to boarding we noticed that we had been allocated seats 9A/10A. Upon bringing the matter to the attention ground staff we were given seats 12A/B. However, on boarding our connecting flight FRA-IST we noted that seats 12E/12F were not additional leg room; the plane being an A321. The same aeroplane and same problem on journey leg IST-FRA. The final leg FRA-MAN presented the same problem, this time being an A319. Given that we had the correct row number for the first leg of our outward journey, we have no complaints other than the stress caused by the initial seat numbering. Having paid for the additional service we were not given the leg room seats as the only seat plan showing at the time of booking was the A320 configuration.

During baggage drop-off informed about free upgrade to premium economy which was received with big smile, and even bigger question mark above my head as I was denied pay upgrade? Spent 2 hrs in the business lounge in T1 which follows Lufthansa standard food and catering options. Boarded clean and well maintenanted A340-600, greeted by smiling crew. Premium economy seat is comfortable and spacious, has good recline and very good legroom. Small bottle of water and premium economy amenity kit at seat. IFE screen is large and picture quality is excellent. I like the Lufthansa IFE selection and audio programs are my favorites. As flight is only 7hrs I watched only one movie, but listened to a few music albums. Food is served on tray and I did not see any difference in options compared to economy. Dinner and light breakfast were served during the flight. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient, I felt like a guest, not a passenger. Arrival was with a small delay, connecting flight to Zagreb on clean A319 on time, I slept the whole flight. Miles were credited next day. Due free upgrade overall experience was even higher then expectations and I can strongly recommend Lufthansa's premium economy product for business traveler on a budget."

The first flight was cancelled while we were taxing due to a problem with an engine switch. The few agents in Buenos Aires had problems dealing with the number of passengers. They weren't able to handle re-booking requests at the airport, but advised to call the call-center in Buenos Aires. Unfortunately, no one picked up at this time of the day. I was only re-booked on the next-day flight after I called Lufthansa in Germany. My seat was 85A on the upper deck which I prefer because you don't have a lot people walking around in the cabin. Two to three flight attendants took care of us on this 14 hour flight. The seat is comfortable and the footsie issue a lot of people complain about wasn't a big deal for me. The cabin layout is quite nice. However, it's difficult to leave your seat if your neighbour turned the seat fully flat and you happen to sit by the window. Then you have to climb over your neighbour. The food was great, however this flight was one of the last ones which didn't offer Lufthansa's new catering service. IFE was good with a large selection of movies. The flight attendants were friendly they always addressed me by name, which was nice. My neighbour was Japanese and one flight attendant spoke to him in fluent Japanese. The amenity kit was okay but other airlines offer a better product. "

We traveled as a group of three seated in a small Economy class section between Business and Premium Economy class, which was a quiet and calm area. Crew was good, but not as good as ANA's crew on our first flight. Cabin announcements were too quiet and difficult to understand. Seat is a typical standard economy seat, seat pitch and width were okay. Lufthansa's plus were catering and entertainment. We got two full meals, a snack in the middle of the flight, and a small snack after take-off. All meals were very tasty and sufficient. Lufthansa has also a large selection of drinks including alcoholic beverages. Drinks were also offered by the crew during the flight. Entertainment system was fantastic with a wide selection of movies and music channels. Lufthansa also has one live TV channel, so I had the chance to watch a Premiere League football match, which was a nice touch. I've been flying with Lufthansa for a couple of years now, European and intercontinental flights, and can highly recommend this airline!"

Selected seat in main cabin on lower deck as it feels much more spacious than the upper deck. Seat was a center aisle seat with plenty of space between the two seats. Seating and lounge position was very comfortable. Screen is nice and entertainement had plenty of options to choose from. Only minus in my opinion is the lack of stowage and the rather small seat width around the shoulders when fully reclined. The issue with the feet being close to the neighbour didn't really disturb me. Food was good but not excellent. Crew was great. Had about 7 hours of sleep and arrived well rested.

We are both seniors. Our row was directly behind row 44, which is the bulkhead row. Sitting there, I expect that there may be a baby or two seated in front of us, but not five (5) as was the case on this flight. As the plane attained altitude the woman in front of us changed her baby's diaper in the seat. The staff softly mentioned to her that changing should be done in the restrooms, and then proceeded to reward her behavior with a multitude of gifts for her two children. The children acted out, screaming and yelling, setting off the other children in the row during the entire flight. They were continually rewarded with extra attention from the flight attendants, while we struggled to get their attention for basic service. Surely five is too many young children too be in one row, making the flight a miserable experience for everyone seated around them. Lufthansa needs to disperse the children on any flight, so they don't constitute a critical mass of misery for all the paying passengers around them. At the very least, all other passengers should get their fair share of attention from the flight staff. This arrangement demonstrated very poor judgement on Lufthansa's part."

Thanks to my Star Alliance Gold membership I was able to use the first class check in, which was very nice. Staff really friendly and helpful. In contrast to that however, was the receptionist at the lounge. She was grumpy and unfriendly. The lounge was rather crowded. Food selection was OK and there was a rather vast selection of beverages available which was nice. DUS to FRA is too short for any kind of service for economy class. The hardware is the Lufthansa hardware for short haul flights. Nice and comfy for short flights. Transfer in Frankfurt was unpleasant due to the long walking distance. I went directly to the gate where the boarding procedures were comencing shortly after. I was able to use priority but the procedure seemed very smooth. Shortly after take off menus were distributed, however, only to some of the economy class passenger. Also, there was no choice between food options later on. I know some passenger had a different menu. Crackers and drinks were served. I ordered water and tomato juice, but my juice was forgotten and I was left with only salt and pepper until I had to remind the FA. Approxmately 3hrs after take off dinner was served.  Food was tasty, and the portion itself was comparable to other economy classes. The seat comfort was better than I had expected. The seats recline nicely and there is a decent amount of legroom available. When I wasn't enjoying the new very good entertainment system I was able to catch some good sleep. During flight, the FA served water and juice and there was a self service bar for drinks and crackers in the galley. Shortly before arriving for a technical stop in Kuala Lumpur breakfast was served. Containing of scrambled eggs and potaoes along with the usual items. Most of the passengers left in Kuala Lumpur and the airplane was pretty empty when we were heading to Jakarta. A nice and fresh sandwich and drinks were served on this short trip. Overall I would say a good experience. Not the top level five star experience you get from some carriers, but quite OK. "

Aircraft were clean and tidy, IFE good but not exceptional, touch screens responsive enough and a adequate range of content. The slim line seats are okay for if you stretch a bit. Our seat choices were honoured as well. Food was edible but bland. What impressed me was how Lufthansa dealt with a delay issue (not LH fault) by proactively booking passengers through on alternates while we were still airborne to FRA. What didn't impress me was the lack of enforcement of cabin baggage rules on the US-EU sector, if you werent on the plane in the first 10 minutes of boarding, you had nowhere to put luggage due to all the maximum sized carry ons already occupying the overheads. The European flights had nice sandwiches and seemed more roomy - with more restraint in overhead usage space."

It was definitely way better and more comfortable than the one I took with Lufthansa one year ago. They were the kindest cabin crew, they smiled a lot, but not with fake smile. When I was forgotten during beverage service once, I was apologized many times for that. Food was served twice (full meal and snack) and beverages few times, probably 3 or 4. I was seated at the beggining of my part of aircraft, middle corridor, so no seat was in front of me, although it didn't mean more space for legs. Plane wasn't full, which means that journey was way more comfortable. Many passangers had 2 seats for themselves, some had more. Only one thing that I didn't like was comfort of the seat. It was too thin. More up-to-date films would be appreciated if they really want to be 5-star airline (and their crew behaviour suggests so)."

Before the flight, I visited the First Class Terminal. Having been there a few years before, it's amazing how Lufthansa keeps the service at such a high level. When the plane was ready to board, I was driven to the 747-8 with a Porsche Cayenne. First Class has eight seats, however, on this flight it was only one other passenger and myself. From the moment I boarded the plane, two flight attendants looked after us for the next 14 hours. The seat has to be the most comfortable on any plane these days. I sat on 2A, which is my favourite. Lufthansa did a really amazing job. The amenity kit might not be as luxurious as on other carriers, but it was good for me. They gave me a Pyjama from van Laack in which I could sleep. The food was superb and I was served several starters. One of the flight attendants offered to prepare another main dish if I didn't like the course I ordered. It was followed by desserts and pralines. The service was very kind and attentive without being intrusive.  IFE was great and had a fairly large selection of movies, tv shows, music and other things. When I was ready to sleep, the flight attendant made the bed on the seat behind me (3A). The bedding was almost as good as a regular one from home. They also put something like a mattress on the seat to make it more comfortable. I asked to be woken up two hours before landing in Buenos Aires and so I was.  On this flight, the purser came around three times to check on me and the other passenger. On arrival in Buenos Aires we were greeted by a representative who explained us how the immigration process works and told us that our luggage would be delivered to a dedicated luggage belt. I highly recommend Lufthansa First Class. It's not cheap, but it's a top-notch product."

On both directions I changed planes in Frankfurt. The service on board was adequate for the duration. The Frankfurt to Malta portion is a little over 2 hours. For the first time in a long time the flight attendants were smiling and seemed to like what they are doing. On each flight we were served a sandwich, which was pretty good and free drinks, including alcoholic beverages. Lufthansa needs to work on is their in-flight entertainment. No entertainment options. Usually their in-flight magazine contains some interesting articles, but not this time.  The planes were clean, in good shape and the legroom is good compared to other economy classes. Be prepared to walk at lot at Frankfurt airport, especially if you need to switch from area B to area A. Although in the same terminal it takes easily 15-20 minutes. If the price is right I suggest to try it for yourself. Just be careful as Lufthansa introduces more and more hidden fees depending on your fare."

The Lufthansa lounge at Terminal 2 Heathrow is spacious, but gets busy during early morning peak travel times. With Senator card able to use that section of the lounge - which was clean and nicely presented, good choice of newspapers and magazines. Food here is provided by Do&Co which I tends to equate to a great quality. Freshly baked croissants at 05.10am on a Monday morning is nice to find. Onboard it was the standard Lufthansa short haul business cabin, with middle seat left empty. Breakfast was a cold plate choice and warm rolls offered, all of good standard. Newspapers and magazines also supplied in this cabin. Good info from cockpit and staff service was efficient. Return trip did not have time to use Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt - boarding by bus to a very remote stand. Late lunch cold cut tray offered, drinks and coffee, but service was not so good. The cabin staff meant to be serving in business class quickly disappeared to help in Economy cabin and not seen for the rest of the flight."

Very good experience: online check in perfect in all aspects, and all flights on time. Friendly and smiling crews, and impressive how the crew reacted to a medical urgency on the MUC-HAM leg: they stopped immediately the service and made an announcement to find a doctor (luckily onboard) and did everything to help this passenger. Afterwards they resumed with the service and apologized for the interruption! "

The aircraft itself is really great. Seats, space, entertainment, everything. The rating is more for the aircraft, than the airline as you cannot give a bad rating to this aircraft. A380 was in a really good condition, clean and the entertainment for the 10hr flight was very good. The staff was kind, helpful and the entire flight was very smooth. One of the best airlines.

I had 40 minutes between flights and I was really surprised that my luggage arrived at my final destination. In these short flights, there is no inflight entertainment. Being only a short flight of less than 2hrs, we had a small breakfast and drinks. The aircraft was very clean as well and we arrived as usual in time with no delays. Lufthansa is still great."

Flew Bremen-Munich-Milan and back via Frankfurt. All flights on time and pleasant. Flight crews were professional, friendly and highly efficient. On all flights the captain or co-pilot was standing at the front and welcoming the passengers. On A321 flights you can use boardconnect, the wireless IFE on your iphone or laptop, wonderful feature where you can download all kind of magazines and newspapers, watch movies and see the flight route for free. Wifi is announced for 2016 on intraeuropean services. On all flights (even the short hop Frankfurt-Bremen 35 min) full bar service including wines and a snack like sandwich or crackers. Munich is a great airport to transfer within minutes. Highly organized, Lufthansa offers all passangers free hot beverages at the gates and free newspapers. Frankfurt the ways can be quite long, depends on where you land and depart. But fine too. All in all besides its subsidiary Swiss the best way to travel within Europe."
1611,,Claus Madsen,Denmark,20th September 2015,"""new personalised long-haul Business Class""",A380,Business,Business Class,BLL to LAX via FRA,August 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,10,"Together with my wife, I experienced Lufthansa’s new personalised long-haul Business Class service on an A380 flight between Frankfurt and Los Angeles. Lufthansa’s ambition is to become Europe’s first five-star airline and measured by the new C-Class service concept, they will get there. The service was impeccable with the flight attendants competently managing the fine line between attentive and personal helpfulness and care – and well-meant, if imposing suffocation of passengers. Kudos to the cabin staff. The food was the well-tasting and delicious food, best I’ve had on a long-haul flight, wines were excellent too. The cabin was well-appointed, colours pleasant, and lots of space for your carry-on luggage. The IFE programme was impressive (but this has become an industry standard, I guess), including the large screens. The not-quite-so-new fully reclineable (‘lie-flat’) seats have been described by others. Since I’ve been flying on the South American services, which appeared to be the last to receive these ‘new’ seats, it was still a new experience for me. Hence a couple of words about the seats: they are certainly not bad. The foot-end is rather narrow – perhaps too narrow for comfort – and I don’t really understand the reasoning behind it. Space in general does not seem to be missing. Another minor issue is the compartment under the in-seat entertainment monitor. This is where you find your kit with socks, toiletries etc. In our case, you couldn’t close it properly, simply because it seemed to be poorly made (I’ve noticed it on a recent 747-8 flight, too). Flying on the world’s biggest and heaviest passenger plane and then not being able to shut a compartment box somehow feels silly. But it’s a detail that in no way spoils the general impression and, indeed, five-star experience."

Excellent flights with professional and charming flight attendants on both flights. From São Paulo to Frankfurt on brand-new jumbo jet with new business seats. Very good seat comfort and enough space, quite ample inflight entertainment, tasty and high-quality food. The flight attendants make the real difference, and are really top notch! Very attentive, friendly and responsive. I like the lounge music channel no. 8! Fast wifi on board. Business lounge in Frankfurt is also very good with good buffet and shower facilities. And on the 30 minutes flight to Hannover the service was impressive, a full meal was served (see photo). Only the seat comfort on intra European flights could be better. But they stream you the inflight entertainment on your tablet or phone, a great extra. In total, Lufthansa has improved significantly its service and product and it's a pleasure to fly with this airline!"

Fortunately, I missed the LH pilots' strike by one day. As a Star Gold, I used the business class check-in, which was friendly and efficient. Boarding was punctual and disciplined, but we all ended up on the same bus. Onboard, I had a window seat in a row to myself. Breakfast service was prompt. The meal was tasty and LH offers sparkling wine even in economy. We departed and arrived on-time, and luggage was waiting when we cleared immigration. The most impressive feature of the flight was the onboard entertainment streamed to the passenger's own ipad. The live route map can be enlarged to a point where you see the airplane actually moving over detailed terrain. I am looking forward to my return flight on Tuesday."

Flight to FRA delayed by 45 minutes due to no show pax, barely made the connecting flight. Seated on the A380 upper deck for the flight to Mexico, and it was very spacious and the seat was comfortable - although a bit narrow. The seat next to me was empty otherwise not sure if I would particulary like the design of the foot divider. Notice there was no divider to separate myself and the pax next to me which isn't ideal. Food was ok, nothing special. Good IFE selection. Overall a good product but something should be done about adding more privacy between pax and separate out the foot divider as LH have done on the A340-600 series."

The catering has become meager (a small package with biscuits and one drink). The flight back was almost one hour late. The Boeing 737 on the flight back looked slightly tired, uncomfortable and worn seats and had not been cleaned properly before the flight (my tray was full of sticky spots and crumbs, cabin wall also had beverage splashes on it). In Frankfurt and Bologna we had parking positions away from the terminal which meant bus transfers - in Frankfurt they were quite long,  plus 15 minute taxiing from the runway to our parking position. While the announcements in German were good, those in English were shorter, spoken in a hurried way and not very easy to understand."

The return from Munich it was raining heavily, and we had to take a shuttle bus to the plane. When we arrived at the plane, everybody just ran for it. No staff there with umbrellas or to coordinate. Given how strict Lufthansa are eg. With luggage weight, the number of pieces of luggage etc, you would think they had better coordination in bad weather. "

There was a delay in departure of almost an hour due to an airport operational issue but we were kept well informed by the captain and well attended to by the cabin crew. I chose sleep over dinner which was served shortly after take off, but the menu offered a good and varied choice. The A380 is wonderfully quiet and the flat bed seats are comfortable so I was able to sleep soundly for most of the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic and a credit to Lufthansa. I did not use the IFE on this flight. Breakfast was delicious, offering a selection of hot and cold dishes as well as very good coffee, with plenty of time to enjoy the meal before preparation for landing.

The onboard seating had plenty of legroom for a short flight, but was rather narrow. A small pack of biscuits and a drink were offered by the hard-working and friendly crew. Transit at Frankfurt involved bus transfers at each end and wading through the very crowded terminal. We made it but our luggage didn't. The onward flight was similar to the first, with a tasty sandwich and a drink offered. Both flights operated roughly on time, despite the second cabin crew having to spend a lot of time helping some passengers to store grossly oversized items of hand luggage.

Most of the cabin crew members spoke Greek fluently, which was of great assistance to the non-English/German speakers on board. However, the service was not good for my standards as I spotted rudeness coming from several flight attendants.

The check-in lady seemed a bit unfriendly to start with but credit to her and her supervisor for doing their best to check our bags all the way through (the system didn't allow it in the end). Compared to other European airlines you don't get much for food - just a slice of cake and a drink, but for a short flight this isn't a major issue for me.

We departed from Chicago O'Hare with a slight delay, but it was caused by bad weather conditions and airport traffic. After that, the takeoff and flight, as well as landing, were pleasant and smooth. There was enough legroom even in economy class and the flight crew were very professional. The onboard entertainment system was really good - many new movies, tv series. The only problem for me was food, because it was really awful, especially in comparison to my previous flight from Frankfurt to Chicago O'Hare, where the food was quite tasty.

On the short flight to Munich from Frankfurt, we were served Leibniz Minis during boarding and inflight, were served only drinks. This wouldn't happen on an American based airline. Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched. The A340-600 is a beautiful aircraft and the flight could not have gone better. All the flight attendants  were attentive, very friendly, and spoke mostly English on flight to Newark. You were served many choices of drinks throughout the flight, given crackers, meal choice was between Cheese Ravioli with Spinach and Beef, and were later given something before arrival. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies, shows, games, and music. My only two issues were at check in, you do everything yourself (weighing, tagging, and placing luggage on belt) and during boarding, it was pretty chaotic. I must also say pay for the seat selection. It's worth it if the flight is oversold. I recommend Lufthansa for travel to Germany and beyond."

Food was okayish not that outstanding. In flight entertainment was really good as there were varieties of things to choose from and touch screen was also very responsive. Overall it was a good flight. Munich to Vancouver we had to board via a bus. As soon as I got into the plane the plane was full. Not even a single sear was empty so I knew this time I couldn't be lucky to not get a seat just for myself. Ended up sitting on a window seat with a decent man beside me. As soon as I turned on the flight entertainment I was disappointed. The touch wasn't responsive at all like it was on my previous flight.

Staff was extremely friendly and courteous, meal service on both short legs was exceptional quality; priority luggage arrived early on arrival. Only Frankfurt airport is sort of a let-down - dingy, crowded, long walks through rather untidy corridors; a nice touch by Lufthansa is that at the gates they offer free daily newspapers and free coffee, tea, cocoa as well as water on self-serve basis."

You can board the plane directly from the lounge. No need for queuing. In the rear of the B747-8 some economy class seats in rows B and I have extra space since there are no A and K seats. The food was served relatively fast after takeoff in order to give you as much time for sleeping as necessary. The cabin crew were very attentive, ensuring that passengers do not recline back during dinner and breakfast and giving you a second helping for wine and soft drinks. New economy seats are comfortable and offer sufficient space to sleep well. Inflight entertainment still has the best selection of classical and jazz music of any airline I know."

Traveling with young children is stressful for any family, but traveling next to unrelated unsupervised kids is surely most people's idea of hell. After 45 mins of arguing we finally managed to secure two pairs of seats in different sections of the plane, sandwiched between strangers. I know it is the modern way to extract every dollar out of the customer through random taxes and numerous surcharges, but it doesn't make any sense to scatter family members throughout the plane.  Maybe Lufthansa should automatically allocate seats for families with young children or be transparent and honest about hidden costs of securing seats. I'm not sure the current policy is very customer inspired for the family traveller or the individual that could be sittings next to an unsupervised, emotional and tired young child. "
1645,,Bojan Tercon,Singapore,10th August 2015,Lufthansa customer review,Boeing 747-8i,Solo Leisure,First Class,Frankfurt to New York,August 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"Lufthansa's first class product is truly world class. Flying in seat 1A on the 747-8i from Frankfurt to New York was like sitting in a decked out BMW. Everything in the cabin exuded luxury and precise German engineering. The leather of the seat and the console. The seat movements were effortless. The table slid in and out from the side console without any resistance. It is a quality product. Even the details in the bathroom made it a pleasure to hang out there. Although the cabin has a very open feel, unlike the very private suites on Singapore Airlines or Emirates, there is a side panel that you can lift that creates enough privacy if you so desire it. The catering was superb, as was the service. European professionalism with class. Add to that the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and the drop-off to the plane in a white Porsche, and you get a Top 3 global first class product. If I had to change one thing, it would be the video screen. It’s far too small for a product like this. It doesn’t do justice to the rest of the cabin. My only question now is: why can't LH make their business class as superb in comparison to other airlines?"

Nobody was waiting for us and we had to run from one side of the airport to the other, and Frankfurt airport is a huge airport. When I arrived all passengers had already boarded. Then in Chicago I got another surprise - my luggage did not make it on the plane. I went to the Lufthansa booth to fill the form and they told me the suitcase would arrive on the next day flight and I should expect it for around 5pm (it arrived at midnight). They gave me a bag with toothpaste, toothbrush, a deodorant and some other items. The onboard service was good. Food was good. The cabin was nice with new furniture. WI-FI didn't connect."

Staff are friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable, and needed to be so, as Lufthansa seem to have a unique way of putting a plane down quite hard onto the runway. My only criticism is with the lack of organisation at the check-in gates, with flights sometimes not being called properly so that passengers mill around not knowing what is going on. This aspect is even worse when things go wrong, as they often do on the trip to and from Salzburg as a result of delays and cancellations due to adverse weather. There is very little signage or help from Lufhansa staff in such circumstances."

Based on this experience I would not recommend Lufthansa for economy class long-haul. The space between seats was very cramped (worst I've had on long-haul). This was for an 11 hour flight. Quality of food was poor, essentially inedible. On positive side, staff were friendly, flight was punctual, entertainment system was good."

The service was great and the seats were very comfortable, especially on the brand new 747-800. The only negative point is the inattentive and rude ground staff at Fiumicino airport. Overall I would recommend Lufthansa on this route. The business class service is excellent, almost on par with that offered by Swiss."

Complimentary sandwiches and beverages served en route. Effortless connection to onward flight to Canada on arrival in Munich. Received an unexpected upgrade to Business Class, which was a wonderful experience with more personalized service, good food, a decent selection of documentaries to watch (which I prefer to movies), and a comfortable recliner seat."

The 747 had the new slim seats and the passenger in front of me had his seatback reclined the entire flight. The movie screen was so close to my face. The beverages were passed out in very small plastic glasses and rarely more than half full. One has to ask for 2-3 cups to get a healthy amount of fluids. The flight attendents hid behind the curtains much of the flight, discouraging passengers from walking in the aisles. "

The seats are the usual economy seats with the middle seat empty. However, what I’m always amazed with Lufthansa is how even on a 55 min flight they can provide you with a delicious, fresh and well presented meal. On such short flights, where seats on various European airlines are often very similar, it’s a memorable meal like this that can make all the difference."

Acceptable ANA lounge. Not a friendly welcome on board. Seat 1A is the best, with a lot of room, much wider. Service was extremely friendly, especially from the Japanese attendant who was completely dedicated to customers. Unfortunately western food was horrible, it seemed old, no taste - crew did not accept that I switch to Japanese menu. Wine list as poor as on the way to KIX. Catering was below international standards in Asia. Connection in FRA was quick (arr and dep in Term B); however no lounge on the Schengen part of Term B. A trap. Bus to aircraft. Nice welcome, nice snack, very friendly service."

Lufthansa could not help that at Rome Airport the lounges were closed, however a voucher of 10€ was rather limited - for a small snack and 2 basic non alcoholic drinks I paid 17 €. Flight delayed on departure due to extremely strong winds at Frankfurt airport. Once boarded FA's were friendly - meal was rather basic for this flight, drinks just OK. Frankfurt to Brussels flight had a delay of nearly one hour due to stormy winds. When seated for 20 minutes onboard, drinks were provided to all passengers. Captain did give ample information - meal ok, luggage could have been faster at Brussels airport."

Easy boarding Process in Nuremberg, friendly staff on board. After arriving in Frankfurt, due to short connection, direct transfer with a limousine was already organized. LH440 - 06/07/2015, A380. Unfortunately when arriving at the gate to Houston, plane was delayed due to technical issues. Ground staff were confused, delayed the boarding twice. Boarding started about 45 min later than normal. Due to the amount of seats in business class, there were already 2 lines of about 40 people each for the boarding process. When boarding started the ground staff did that manually in only one line, without activating the two self service scanners. After 20 min I went to the purser and asked if she can assist me with boarding (First/Sen). She told me the boarding process had already started (sure, I was waiting there) and I can board after queuing in the line. After I asked why the scanners were not activated, she looked confused around and asked some colleagues, who then activated the scanners, which gave me the possibility to board. Unfortunately already a lot of people from Economy had boarded, which caused a delay on the stairs to the two bridges (First/Business and Economy). Overall my worst boarding process flying First with LH. Welcome on board was great, service and food thru the entire flight the same. Great people and a big thank you to the team of LH. The pilot could not catch up, so when we landed in Houston and the door opened, I had 10 minutes connection time to the boarding to TPA on C34. Fortunately it worked out with Global entry and a 15 min delay of my flight to Tampa."

TAP Lounge is closed now, and no alternative is offered for the moment. Flight delayed 30 mins due to late arrival from previous sector. Nice, but not overly friendly cabin crew. Only one FA looked presentable, others looked shabby and tired, but still, they always smiled. Nothing special about food - little tray with hot pasta, one bread roll and tiny Mars bar. Boring. IFE streaming to your own device was a nice touch, but flight itself is nothing to remember."

Gate to Munich is right next to the Lounge. Warm welcome from the ground staff, excellent food and wine. Easy boarding process for First Class due to a direct door from the lounge to the jet bridge of the plane. Very warm welcome from the cabin team. Very good food on board with excellent Service. One hour before landing I got my wake up call with a easy and lite breakfast. Overall a great flight. Easy and fast Immigration in Munich with Custom/Federal Police office in the Lufthansa Lounge. Pick up with the Limousine worked perfect to the small Airplane to Nürnberg,like everything worked out on this trip."

When entering the aircraft we noticed that the seats in Business Class were the same as in economy and the legroom was the same. The seats were uncomfortable. Usually when you come into Business Class in an airplane you are greeted with a drink (water, juice or wine), but not on that flight. The stewardess did not pay much attention to us. No english newspapers. We had a little boy with us (8 years old) and when his mother asked for a pillow and blanket, only 2 pillows where found in the whole plane and 2 blankets. We waited a long time until food service started, even economy passengers in back of us got service before us. We were served 20 min later. As I said before the seats were very uncomfortable and as I am not a small man I could not put the tray all the way down because the legroom between the seats was not that much. 7th July 2015, Frankfurt to Keflavik Iceland, flight LH856. The same poor quality seats. We asked for a pillow and a blanket but there was only one blanket and no pillows in the whole plane. The reason we were given was that the plane came in over night and all blankets and pillows were used! The stewardess onboard was very nice and tried to calm me down, the reason she said that the seats weren´t better than this was that the flight was short haul. I fly all over Europe at least 15 times a year and everywhere, the Business Class has better seats. "

I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not Lufthansa´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew. I am afraid Lufthansa is rapidly ceasing to be my first choice. What a shame, when only better information would deal with this problem. The very value for money that I used to appreciate - pay more but get something for it - rapidly slips with such treatment."

Connecting in FRA extremely stressful (this airport is now worse than CDG), I had 60 mn to do it. It took 30 mins only to arrive at terminal, due to very very remote parking plus a lot of airplane traffic that stopped our bus. Then a long queue at Immigration, and very remote finger (Z62). Boarding had started when I arrived. Service on upper deck (FRA to KIX) was pleasant but slow, the food was delicious. Brand new flat seats, a bit too narrow, but pleasant anyway. Wine list : the weakest point. Germany has so many nice wines they could have offered but Italian and Chilean instead. Champagne at high standards. Luggage quickly delivered."

She was helped into her seat by the very friendly cabin crew who escorted her from the aircraft entrance and I was helped with my onboard luggage. During the flight the flight attendants helped my mother with the food, something that I greatly appreciated. Upon arrival in Frankfurt we were met by very friendly and professional Lufthansa ground services personnel who escorted her and myself all the way to the Sheraton Airport hotel as there was a 12 hour wait between both flights and later came to the hotel to pick us up for our onward journey. The flight to Amman was on a small Airbus 320 however the cabin crew were extremely professional and helped us throughout. I am very pleased with Lufthansa and will certainly fly them again."

Tried to do the online check in and it only worked for one of our tickets. When we got the the airport the lines for check in were long so we all went to the online check in counter and they allowed us to check in. Flight on time and boarding was quick. They serve a horrible roll after take off at 1am which was inedible. Seats quite uncomfortable. Headsets can hardly hear and this looked like a new aircraft. Crew was pleasant enough. Overall uneventful flight. Landed in MUC on time with a 40 minute connection and had to run for our next flight which we made with moments to spare. LH did nothing to make the connection easier which they so proudly advertise. Service on MUC to BCN much nicer - sandwich was lovely and fresh as was the coffee.

Even though I used to prefer airlines with a stop-over we used LH direct flight due to the short travel time. The newly launched connection FRA-KUL is really worth the extra money. Lufthansa is clean, efficient and friendly. The seats were very comfortable, screen was big and food was ok. I slept for a straight 8hr and my wife slept 9.5hrs. We were really pleased with the service and comfort of this new connection/product. I haven't been a big Lufthansa fan in the past but this somehow changed my mind. We will come back."

Flight on time. Check in at LIS was a breeze and flight on time. Breakfast served was okay and service was nice on this 3 hour flight. Got to FRA with a 2 hour connection. Had to get from one end of the terminal to the other and we kind of ran as we were a bit lost. Got to our gate and sat down to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting and near the boarding time I went to the desk to ask the status and was told we were delayed 3 hours. They did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards. LH then started handing out 5 euro meal vouchers- nothing in the canteen nearby was available to eat for 5 euros! Flight finally left 4 hours late and arrived at 5am in Mumbai instead of 1am. The food was awful. Seats on the 747 as uncomfortable as the A330. Crew were polite.

On board it was a fresh looking A330 with new Business Class seats. These are an improvement over the older angled seats but they are inferior to pods found on other carriers. In the fully flat position there is little space for your feet and overall, the seat is narrow. Flight left late due to congestion at FRA and arrived slightly behind schedule. The service was fairly attentive with FA's smiling throughout the flight. The appetizer was delicious but my lunch selection was overcooked and was quite bland. There were a wide selection of spirits and drinks to choose from and the wines served were fairly good. Pre-arrival meal was tasty and the portions were quite big. The IFE had a poor selection of movies and lacked in the number of new releases for both movies and music although the Bose noise-cancelling headphones were a nice touch. Upon arrival luggage was delivered promptly topping off a good experience."

The flight to Frankfurt was delayed, with no explanation offfered. No seating was available at the gate. It was a mater of just wait and don't block the passageway. No information was given on board about the connecting flights. No effort was made to fast track passengers to make connecting flights. Enroute to the gate to get the Johannesburg flight we were informed by other passengers that the flight had left. Again there were no announcements. No Lufthansa representative was assigned to deal with passengers that were stranded. The group was split as some passengers did not have visas to enter Germany. After much walking and asking random people what to do, we found a service desk with staff willing to assist. This was also stressful as it was late and everyone was going off shift. The airport was near deserted except for the confused and stressed passengers, some of whom were travelling with small children. We were given a taxi, hotel and meal vouchers for the overnight stay. We had no luggage so a change of clothes and toiletries were an issue. We have been re-routed via Lagos with a 6 hour layover. "

Hope was given to us by the crew as they said everything was delayed and so we had a good chance but this was a false hope. On the Paris flight the English announcements were hard to hear as the sound was not turned up loud enough to overcome all those that had understood the German announcement and were now talking loudly. Attendants on Dubai flight were friendly and professional. There was mixed customer care when hundreds filed in to the customer service area. Some received overnight kits some received juice and water and some did not. The processing of people got faster when a second area opened up downstairs. Again mixed customer service. I got great service with all vouchers explained as well as clearly written on what was what as well as a meal voucher where as a lady I buddied up with didn't get as good service and no meal voucher. On return to Frankfurt airport the next day for rebooking great professional staff sorting out re ticketing of new flights. Accommodation was supplied in Frankfurt and also at layover on Dubai. This was fabulous. Overall my experience of Lufthansa is very good. I would fly with them again.

While boarding the aircraft an announcement was made for priority boarding of business class passengers and those with Star Alliance Gold status. As a Gold member I moved into the priority line and when checking my boarding pass the gate agent complained about me going ahead even though the announcement clearly allowed for it. Once on board the aircraft was in pristine condition. As it was not a full flight I moved into a row all to myself and had a very comfortable journey. The FA's were not particularly friendly and performed the inflight service like preprogrammed robots. The dinner served was fairly basic but quite tasty. Flight left late but the crew me up for the delay resulting in on schedule arrival. The bags took nearly 40 minutes to come out and those tagged ""priority"" came out last. Overall it was a good travel experience but below the standard I have come to expect from Lufthansa."

Frankfurt to Johannesburg I was seated in Economy as usual, but just before take-off it was announced that seats were available in Premier Economy at the extra cost of 300 Euros. I asked a flight attendantif I could look at the seats before I committed to paying the extra money and she kindly took me through - I was delighted to see seats in this class were far superior to Economy. I agreed to pay the extra, was moved to my new seat and from then on my flying experience turned out to be one of the best I had ever had, it was brilliant, I felt that I was treated like a VIP. The flight attendant couldn't have been more helpful and kinder. I would defintely recommend Premium Economy to anyone. Thank you Lufthansa and your staff."

Check in at Lufthansa at new Terminal 2 Heathrow at 06.00 in morning chaotic and lengthy - lots of passengers, too few check-in staff, check in equipment seemed not to be functioning well. Transfer at Frankfurt is complicated and long, compared with for example, Schipol, but better than Paris. All flights pretty full - but full compliments to Lufthansa cabin crew, very friendly and attentive given busy short haul flights. Complete punctuality. Also, a nice touch that pilot comes out of cockpit to say goodbye to passengers at end of flight. In contrast to Heathrow, check in at Barcelona extremely quick and efficient. All in all a good experience. ( As a bit of plane spotter, a bonus was that the LHR/FRA flight was on a retro livery Airbus!)."

Seats, food, and entertainment systems were on par with other European carriers. The real winner here was the international in-flight WiFi capabilities. The service was a bit hostile and pretentious at time. The meal service seemed a bit rushed and flight attendants nagging passengers to finish."

They only give us a transit time of 1 hour 5 mins. By the time we came down from the plane at Frankfurt, I happened to look up at a clock in the airport, and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. We walked to the gate, and it was a long walk. An airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area, which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to Berlin. He just said the area downstairs was too crowded, so we cannot go down. He held us up for 10-15 mins. Finally, we were allowed to go down, and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance (as compared to over ten in Heathrow airport). That takes another 10 minutes or so. In the end, we reached our gate 2 mins late, and the plane had left without us. After that, customer service was non-existent. This is no fault of ours. They could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. We were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didn't show up. We tried this for one flight, and I refused to do it again. The next available flight was 5 hours later. But we would have reached Berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to London. I have booked this BA flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in Berlin. Yet we had to miss it. To add to the insult, we were told we had to take the flight to Berlin, or they would re-calculate the total cost. In the end, we had to pay out to get a connecting flight to London from Lufthansa."

Crew was professional. Seats not so comfortable like Emirates or Cathay Pacific, but acceptable. For the price I paid, I expected more than I was given.

Staff were on the whole friendly, the planes were a good temperature, and there were only very small delays (20 mins for one connection). Food was nothing exciting but on planes it never is. I brought my own snacks. Entertainment system was a little less modern and the screen smaller than past experience, but it was still fine to pass the hours. Seat wasn't super comfortable and there wasn't loads of leg room, but with the blanket provided it was survivable. For the cheapest option around, that's all I had hoped for. As I said, the staff were friendly and well-presented. Only annoyance was that no-one came around between meals so any queries and assistance were hard to attain. Toilets were fine too. Not lovely, but they are plane toilets."

We were left no choice of meal options twice in a row as we were served last for both in-flight meals, dinner and breakfast. The crew served the meal from the same direction, from the back to front of the cabin both times, and when it’s our turn, we only got whatever was left. We can understand this the first time, but the second time it happened we didn’t get to choose our food, we felt being treated unfairly, and to us it clearly showed that Lufthansa did not care about attending to customers’ needs and respecting their right of choice. We paid our fares as everyone else! It is not about we really have to have that particular food, it’s about the fact this happened twice in a row and obviously did not respect customers choice. We have flown Lufthansa quite a few times, and were very disappointed this is the way Lufthansa treat their customers."

Seat is very comfortable. Food was excellent, crew upbeat and professional.  Pilot updated us on flight details frequently and a smooth landing.

While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats. I'm surprised that Lufthansa would not have designed this section better and that they didn't have a more accurate seat map."

Check-in was not easy, staff was slow and changed the counter several timers from economy to business to only drop off, so the queues changed and it was a big mix up. Could not upgrade as the plane was full. Flight was almost one hour late before take-off, no information given by ground staff at the gate, even though 5 staff were there. Onboard, crew was nice and service was ok, meal choice was chicken or beef and that was tasty. Arriving in Frankfurt was 15 minutes late,so we had 40 minutes to get to the LH train at the airport-station. Bags did arrive at Air rail-terminal on time, but it was not sure if our oversized luggage would arrive on time. Lost and found was kind to fill up a form, before our LH train leaves. Lost and found did a nice and very good job and they were very good and helpful. So we left for the train, on the platform the train was 5 minutes late, and one of the fine lost and found staff came with our bulk luggage to give it to us.

Arrived with LH train ticket via high-speed train in Frankfurt. On check in I asked for upgrade, since I have more than enough miles. Upgrade was granted and walked to their lounge in terminal C close to gate 14. This lounge looks like a more basic lounge and as it was before 10a,m the selection seemed limited. But after one hour we boarded the A321 for Tel Aviv. The plane is a basic Lufthansa plane for short haul, so there are no special Business class seats, only the middle seat is free, which gives you no more legroom. The crew was nice and served a pre-drink, as the flight was about 20 minutes late, due to high traffic in the air. Soon after take-off they served a nice Gin and Tonic with nuts. After that they started the food service on a tray. The food was nice with starter, salad, main dish and fruits. After that they served coffee and chocolate.

Service quality by the staff (attitude, promptness and helpfulness) was 4 out of 5. As for meals I was highly impressed because of their setting.  Metal cutlery (not plastic), menu to read, delicate desserts, and nice dishware. Other than that, the food is OK, the dinner being good while breakfast was  poor.

Onboard service efficient and friendly staff, I like that they still offer you a good choice of magazines even on short flights. A light breakfast served, seats reasonably okay with middle seat empty. In MUC decided to try out the ""paid"" VIP Terminal on way back - wow! It is fabulous and even has its own beer garden and outside dining area. You get taken by car to foot of steps for boarding.

As noted in previous reviews service was curt lacking in smiles or friendliness. Return trip the bathroom was the dirtiest smelliest mess I have encountered on a plane. Is anyone responsible for checking it during the flight? I have very low expectations of food on airplanes but these meals were worst I've ever had. What really has made me decide to never fly Lufthansa again is this: I paid extra to reserve seats in the first row of economy which has a partition in front of you instead of a row of seats and more leg room. When we checked in for our return flight we were told those seats were not available. I was told by customer service that paying extra to reserve a seat gives you no guarantee or rights to those seats and my request for a refund was denied. Absolutely terrible customer service in my opinion.

Some flights were with City line subsidiary some with Lufthansa mainline. City line is better in terms of seat comfort (2-2 on Embraer aircraft plus good seat pitch) but no hot meal service. Lufthansa serves hot meal but seating is crowded and provides less comfort. Also City line crews mostly look disinterested. Ticket prices looked excellent value for money. A big letdown was Frankfurt airport experience. Not a single time had we embarkation or disembarkation via finger. Long bus rides only. To add insult to injury when boarding via bus they never used bus gates. We had 5 flights downstairs from Z gates designated for A380 only to stand for 25 minutes on the apron waiting for the bus to pick us up. Then 20 minutes on a bus standing and waiting for plane stand assignment. Overall very average. Flights are on time. Bags arrived safely.

Thankfully connecting flight from Hong Kong to Adelaide was codeshare with Cathay Pacific who provide a true Premium Economy experience. LH served choice of 2 meals in foil trays coffee and tea in paper cups. Hot paper wipe was provided to freshen up Cathay provide a hot towel. Whilst cabin crew were efficient smiles were rare. Basic headphones provided rather than the noise cancelling variety provided by Cathay. No priority check in or boarding. Plastic tumbler of orange juice given as"" welcome drink"" just before take off. Cathay offer choice of sparkling wine sparkling water or orange juice served in a glass once you are settled in your seat. Blanket provided barely covered knees and legs. Cabin is only separated from economy by a small screen. Seats were comfortable with a reasonable incline although those on Cathay were larger and more incline. Think it is a stretch to call what Lufthansa offer Premium Economy. Disappointing. Better value would be to purchase an economy ticket in the exit row."

We had booked economy but gate staff announced a ""special"" price for surplus seats in premium economy. Well it wasn't bargain basement but a reasonable price. We had already enjoyed P/E on the way over to Europe so thought why not? P/E is well worthwhile and as mentioned for previous flights should be standard. It is just so more comfortable compared with economy but much more affordable than business. Food service all extremely good and IFE is now one of the best on any airline we have traveled with - fast and responsive with a good choice of channels. Lufthansa has had some mixed reviews but I feel it has lifted its game. A380 is a superb aircraft: super smooth and quiet.

Despite having flown between Singapore and Europe several times in recent years this was my first experience of the A380 and I was a little in awe of this giant aircraft. It is an excellent airplane! It makes flying seem so effortless. Super smooth take off and landing and so much quieter than a B777. Legroom is the main advantage of P/E. We firmly believe all airplane seats should be this size. I find standard economy now is so cramped as to be almost unbearable on long flights. The premium is well worth paying for and much more affordable than business if you are paying yourself. IFE was superb fast and responsive and an excellent choice of both video and audio channels. Food was good if not remarkable and service was extremely prompt and polite. Getting on and off was fast. I don't usually sleep much on long flights but did manage to doze a bit and arrived feeling reasonably refreshed after a 12-hour flight.

Short flight on Airbus A321 from Berlin Tegel to Frankfurt hub for intercontinental flight. Once Berlin's new international terminal opens (eventually) these connections won't be needed. Boarding rather chaotic waited in aisle for passengers to get into seats airline should have started boarding rear seats first. Take-off delayed for technical reasons as well but once underway the pilot quickly made up time and the flight was fuss-free. FAs polite and smiled but time for only minimal food and drinks services on this short flight of less than an hour. Disembarking much faster.
1712,,David Killick,New Zealand,31st May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,4,yes,9,FRA-VRN. A short flight across the Alps from Frankfurt to Verona in an Embraer 190 a compact but efficient region jet. Bus across the tarmac hopped on friendly and efficient pilot service minimal but not needed flight seemed fast. Great views the Alps. A good way of traveling a reasonable distance quickly but train just as easier for slightly shorter European connections.
1713,,K Burry,Italy,29th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,YYZ-FRA-NAP I traveled home alone with my baby I didn't think it would be possible but my home-bound flight was an even better experience than my flight out. The staff were extremely helpful. On my first flight there was a problem with my pre-booked seat so I called customer service to ensure my return flight would be correct. The lady whom I spoke to was very helpful and made sure I got the bassinet seat. For the long flight the staff had little Lufthansa toys they gave my baby I really appreciated the thought and had not experienced this with another airline we've flown with. Staff on board constantly checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed and to see if I needed any assistance (baby slept the whole flight). I will only travel with Lufthansa in the future.
1714,,K Burry,Italy,29th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew NAP-MUN-YYZ. I booked a seat ahead of time the aircraft was changed and I didn't get the seat I had booked. As I was traveling alone with an 11-month old it was important I had the correct seat. The flight was fully booked but the staff were wonderful trying to help me out they managed to find a seat where a lady was willing to switch with me so I at least had the single empty seat beside me and my baby wasn't kicking somebody for 9 hours. The man in the seat ahead of me however reclined his seat fully back 10 minutes into the flight and refused to move it forward even for the meals the staff did their best to make me comfortable. Both at the airport and on-board the aircraft the staff did everything in their power to make my travels as easy as possible. The aircraft itself was new and clean. I am average sized and there would have been plenty of space had I not had another person on my lap. I only gave a lower rating for food as it tasted good enough but I am a picky eater. They came around frequently to serve drinks. I will only fly with Lufthansa from now on.
1715,,Trivan Mathur,Switzerland,28th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,4,5 May BOM-MUC LH765. 5 May MUC-GVA LH2382. Business. Ground staff was unfriendly. Airline Grew Ok but nothing special. New b-class seats are not as good as other 4 star airlines. Not worth the money (for b - class at least).
1716,,A Palomo,United Kingdom,27th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,no,6,BHX-FRA-GIG 27/04/15. Return EZE-FRA-BHX 18/05/15. Flight from Birmingham with layover at Frankfurt then on to Rio De Janeiro was nearly faultless. Cabin crew were very attentive and friendly. The equipment used was 747-8 which was a delight fly on. Good selection of in-flight entertainment and food was also good. I asked for a pack of toothbrush and toothpaste and was given straightaway without questions asked and the lady FA had a friendly smile. Flight back from Buenos Aires was somewhat hit and miss. They were asking passengers for an upgrade for a minimum cost. I spent sometime travelling around South America and was down to my last few dollars so wasn't able to avail their promo. I found out later the they have upgraded quite a few passengers even though some of them were not frequent fliers. I am a Miles and More member and also I have got a frequent flier from SK which belongs to Star Alliance and I earned my points for quite some time now. I felt left out by the upgrade and so I asked one of the staff why the Miles and More members had been left out and my queries were rudely brushed aside telling me that 'You only fly economy'. Some of the FA's on board were friendly enough apart from one female FA with a really bad attitude. When I asked for a pack of toothpaste and toothbrush she immediately told me off they haven't got any and why did I bother to asked because I was in the economy section and then she walked away. When I asked one of her colleagues I was immediately handed a pack. I thought that being a Miles and More membership had gone to waste. I'll be thinking twice about flying with Lufthansa again.
1717,,M Zelcevic,Canada,20th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Muscat-Frankfurt (stopover in Doha) on A330. Easy check in and boarding followed by exceptional service by kind and professional FAs. My special meal was acceptable better than normal. IFE was excellent with plenty of choices.
1718,,G Brambilla,United Kingdom,20th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,KUL-FRA LH783 17 May 2015 Business. Extremely comfortable flight. Airplane was very tidy and clean and the new seats are lay flat a considerable improvement with respect to the old Lufthansa business class seats. They provide the possibility to chose the seat firmness and include massage. Meals are top notch. there is wide variety of beverages (I got a fantastic passion fruit juice before taking off). Flight was on time and very smooth indeed. Cabin crew was very attentive. In flight entertainment was very good with a wide range of movies in each category. A superb flight.
1719,,J Williams,United States,12th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,7,Flew Philadelphia - Madrid via Frankfurt on May 1 2015. The flights were on time planes clean and the flight crews friendly. Catering was good. The reason I write this us that the Big Three US airlines provide mediocre - at best - service in economy and could learn how to improve their service and still make a huge profit. Lufthansa was very impressive.
1720,,G Brambilla,United Kingdom,12th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,LH452 21/3/2015. MUC-LAX business class. 5 star treatment. Flat seats very nice choice of food and extremely friendly and helpful cabin crew. The choice of in-flight entertainment is quite good although the overall number of move is available in each category is not very large (20ish). One of the better airlines to fly business class.
1721,,J Williams,United States,12th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,7,Flew Philadelphia - Madrid via Frankfurt on May 1 2015. The flights were on time planes clean and the flight crews friendly. Catering was good. The reason I write this us that the Big Three US airlines provide mediocre - at best - service in economy and could learn how to improve their service and still make a huge profit. Lufthansa was very impressive.
1722,,M J Jordan,Lesotho,11th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Flew TLV-FRA-JNB on April 15 2015. Had a very nice experience A321 from TLV then A380 to JNB. I travel with LH quite frequently and am always pleased with them especially on their A380s. Downside was the price. VERY expensive but I am a Star Alliance member and am collecting miles so It was fine. Food was Salmon and rice then a Steak. A lot of new movies and latest releases.
1723,,Deborah Velie,United States,8th May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,Lufthansa flight LH0408 from Dusseldorf to Newark on Monday April 27 2015. Flight crew was efficient but not especially friendly. The food was the worst airline food I have ever been served. I asked for Diet Coke with the meal and was given a small glass that was half full.
1724,,Gianluca Ratti,Italy,1st May 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Flew SFO-FRA on the A380. 11hr 20min in Y. Boarding at SFO was a mess because of some bad handling of their staff regarding priority boarding of disabled people that were flying with us. On board IFE had a decent selection touchscreen not very responsive though. They served dinner and breakfast in the morning. Honestly both were quite good. Staff were smiling even during breakfast in which they surely looked tired but they kept a professional attitude. They gave us a pillow and a blanket (which were acceptable) and the headset (terrible sadly). During the flight water was distributed frequently and you could also serve yourself in the galley for some snacks or some juice and the staff was gald to help. The recline is not bad at all but the pitch is really lacking sadly. No mood lighting also (which would have been a nice touch). Capt spoke frequently to the cabin also because of some sustained turbulence we had that interrupted breakfast: he assured everything was alright but we were unlucky as some strong tail winds shook us for a good part of an hour on the Atlantic. After we landed it was a mad rush to the connection with Air Dolomiti to Verona: FRA is quite huge and we only had an hour or so. All in all a good experience: I find that atm what sets apart an airline with an another is their staff which I found really helpful kind and respectful. I would fly with them again.
1725,,Michele Caforio,Italy,30th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,KIX-FRA-MXP. Despite the longest security check at Osaka Kansai that I remember once onboard the flight was very good. Both flights on time good comfort on the 747-400 and kind flight staff. Transfer at FRA a bit long but overall ok. Good IFE quality choice fairly good.
1726,,Michele Caforio,Italy,30th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,MXP-MUC-HND. First leg on time (not many snacks considering it was lunchtime). Second leg on an A340-600 plane full and upgraded to business. Good seat comfort and very good service from flight crew. IFE was good in both quality and choice. Despite a delay for tech issues before departure a very good travel experience.
1727,,Konrad Baumgarten,Germany,28th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"I flew LH710 FRA-NRT on an old 747-400. This plane was very old. Most cramped plane I have been on. My IFE screen was broken so I wasn't able to watch movies for eleven hours. Cabin crew wasn't that nice. One steward didn't smile at all. I would have expected more from a ""4 star airline"". Food was ok nothing special. All in all it was an awful experience. This was definitely my last time with LH!"
1728,,A Greenstone,United States,27th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,Flew Kuwait-Frankfurt business class via Airbus 330-300 then Frankfurt-Miami Business Class on the Airbus 330-800. Service was fine and efficient as is typical of Lufthansa. The comfort was awful-seats were so narrow and hard. The worst I have experienced frankly. Never again will I fly them-especially spending all that money on business class.
1729,,Frank J Epple,Germany,24th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,yes,9,I flew LH 520/521 MUC-MEX-MUC on A340-600 recently and need to say everything was as good as it can be in economy. A good flight for LH as the flight was fully booked. Flight attendants polite and friendly food nice drinks offered throughout the flight good IFE and much improved monitors and film selection. Enough information from the cockpit.
1730,,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,20th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,MAD-FRA-JFK. Airport experience in FRA was absolutely the worst. However on board product and service is excellent. First leg on the A321 full bar service and tasty hot breakfast was served despite being a short 2-hour flight. Service was excellent and attentive. Second leg on the A380 and sat on a small section of Economy class on the upper deck. There was a dedicated flight attendant for the mini cabin and service felt very personalized and private. He was extremely attentive caring and friendly. Lunch was delicious and substantial and so was the pre- arrival snack. IFE had a good selection of movies TV shows and cool features like the tail camera and the screen was of decent quality and responsive. Seats were comfortable and reclined a lot although under seat storage was extremely limited due to the IFE box. Despite that minor grip Lufthana's product is definitely top-notch and I have to commend their excellent in flight service from their crew.
1731,,M Temidara,United States,19th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,"I flew with Lufthansa for a connection flight the duration of which was likely no more than 3-4 hours it was a short-haul flight. I needed to freshen up before landing there were no seatbelt signals up so I seized the opportunity to use the lavatory to freshen up. As soon as I finished and exited the lavatory there was a flight attendant waiting for me. I opened the door and this woman was standing in front of the restroom with what seemed like arms folded and a scowling face as though I'd done something wrong. No I wasn't in first class and yes my ""freshening up"" in the lavatory may have taken some time. But at the end of the day I paid for my flight and frankly it is no business of a flight attendant what passengers do in the restroom. She said not one word and basically stared me down as I walked back to my seat. Needless to say the customer service was lacking from the flight staff and I will never fly with Lufthansa again."
1732,,A Acosta,United States,16th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,2,no,3,"4/10/2015 FRA-LAX LH 456. Lufthansa from FRA to LAX on A380 economy class and won't repeat this mistake anytime in the future. Seat pitch is listed as 31"" but felt more like 28"". Width is listed as 17"" and that felt about right. Seat configuration is 3-4-3 which is pretty much standard. It was just too cramped again I believe the pitch that Lufthansa list is wrong as I've never felt so tight with a 31"" pitch and I've recently lost 25 pounds. All else was great. Food was above industry standard staff were polite and attentive after meal drinks were plentiful and included brandy wine and beer at no charge. Snacks were passed out during duration of flight. Flight entertainment was weak but having a place to charge my laptop was handy as well as WiFi although slow and charged at 17euro. Unfortunately I have a bad back and will have to take a different carrier next time out."
1733,,Cristoffer Cedergren,Sweden,16th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,I went from Frankfurt to Singapore in a A380. Lufthansa had changed my prepaid comfort seat to a standard seat because of an equipment change. Drinks and food came in the wrong order. No menus were distributed. Staff were not service minded and looked more interested in playing with their smartphones in the gallery. Movies could not be seen with English subtitles. Not the level I expect from Lufthansa.
1734,,R Nazmul,Sweden,16th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,ARN-MUC-DEL and return from 2 April to 12 April. ARN-MUC and return both operated by A320s MUC-DEL with an A346 and DEL-MUC with a refurbished A333. ARN-MUC departed on-time had checked-in online and we had selected our seats. Everything was as planned our seats did not get mixed up like they usually do on other airlines. Boarding was smooth as expected. The flight was 100% full overheard the flight attendant saying that not a single seat was empty didn't also find an empty seat when I looked around. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive overall the flight was very pleasant. Next flight was MUC-DEL onboard an A346 unfortunately it was a plane with the old IFE and seats but the outstanding service by the friendly flight crew compensated for it. Food was great didn't expect that good food from LH. Legroom was enough for this flight we landed 20 minutes late in Delhi due to thunderstorms in the area. DEL-MUC operated by an A333 with the new cabin very clean plane. It had the new IFE which was very neat looking however I think they need to add more popular albums and more movies. The legroom wasn't great but it was enough for me I'm 177 cm tall. The flight attendants were extremely friendly on this flight as well in fact all of the LH flight attendants were friendly. I don't like to eat breakfast on my flights but the food wasn't bad flight landed exactly on-time in Munich. MUC-ARN once again operated by an A320 flight was on-time with friendly flight attendants again. They served a sandwich on this flight which was not bad. Overall I'm very satisfied with Lufthansa's service very nice flight attendants they also had very helpful ground crew at DEL. I would gladly fly long-haul with them again!
1735,,S Tegtmeier,Germany,12th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Short flights FRA-VIE LH1138 and VIE-FRA LH1137 in April. Excellent flight experience concerning all aspects. After security check in FRA Lufthansa offers coffee and hot drinks for free and also a wide selection of international and German newspapers. During the flight you get a tasty sandwich and full bar service. Seats are comfortable for short haul flights legroom is good. Captain kept us informed about flight route arrival time and weather at destination airports. Cabin crew was fantastic attentive smiling and charming. LH is highly recommended for European flights!
1736,,B Borg,Norway,12th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,OSL-FRA-TXL-FRA-OSL. A couple of hours after I checked-in online the day before I was supposed to travel OSL-FRA- TXL Lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my Lufthansa OSL-FRA sector was cancelled due to Lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. This Lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. Furthermore it was all in vain trying to call Lufthansa's reservations in Norway and elsewhere in Europe - lines were too busy to get through. So despite my very busy schedule I went to Oslo's Gardermoen airport where SAS do the ticketing for Lufthansa. In a very short time SAS rebooked me on the SAS direct morning flight from Oslo to Berlin-Tegel therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by Lufthansa and Lufthansa pilots on strike. I paid extra to fly on Lufthansa as I had to be in Berlin early but in hindsight SAS was cheaper more reliable and better than the competition on this occasion - paying a premium to fly Lufthansa resulted as a waste of money time and effort (given the pilots strike not just SAS but also Norwegian and Ryanair would have been better on this occasion). On the return sectors TXL-FRA-OSL the service was very good and significantly better than I what experienced lately on Lufthansa. However all in all this is was the second time in the space of just 3 months that the industrial disputes between Lufthansa and capricious Lufthansa pilots caused me inconveniences while travelling between Oslo and Berlin. This time the inconveniences were not acceptable to me and as a result similar future travel arrangements will be on other Star Alliance carriers but preferably not Lufthansa.
1737,,Hang Van Hiep,Vietnam,6th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,HKG-MUC on LH 731 seat 10D. The new seat is rather small (~ 47 cm in width) but it is almost flat. The screen for entertainment is approx. 15 inch. Lots of films and musics as well as documentation to watch. Food was good there are less magazines to read than in the past. The new seat is somewhat smaller but you can sleep better since it is almost flat. Impressive.
1738,,Gordon Allan,Canada,4th April 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,In March of 2015 I flew from Vancouver to Frankfurt. As a world traveler I have experienced my fair share of cramped seating but was particularly appalled with the quality of the seating on this flight given that it was an 8-hour flight. The seats bordered on being hard-back chairs with little decline and poor leg room and width. This coupled with a mediocre audio-visual system and totally bland inflight food service left little to like about the airline. Granted the staff were helpful and friendly but in the end I just hated this flight. Impressive.
1739,,Sviatlana Papova,Belarus,28th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Travelled on March 18th from Minsk to Barcelona with a layover in Frankfurt. Both flights were perfect. Great thanks to all the crew members for excellent service and comfort. Yesterday on March 25th took the same flights back from BCN to MSQ! The first flight was rather nice but the plane from Frankfurt to Minsk experienced some technical problems and we had to fly back to Germany. But all the staff members both in the airport and on the plane acted very professionally. We got a new plane and landed safely in Minsk. Impressive.
1740,,Ian Patrick,Kuwait,25th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,I travelled from Kuwait to Frankfurt and back for one night on 17th/18th March. Both flights had the new Business Class seat which is excellent. On both flights the crew were attentive and smiling and the food was very good. Check in at Kuwait was fast and efficient as was the boarding (for an early departure). The flight was short at just over 5 hours 30 minutes but the crew was relaxed and not rushed offering drinks a nice snack and a choice of breakfast. Returning from Frankfurt was equally pleasurable from check in to arrival with only a small delay due to congestion at Frankfurt Airport. Another good flight to Kuwait with equally good crew and catering. Impressive.
1741,,Reinemer Peter,Germany,23rd March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,"LH424 and LH425 MUC-BOS and BOS-MUC on March 9 and March 11. Very good in principle high safety and service standards however planes a bit outdated more recently and poor seat comfort and space. Frequent traveler program ""miles and more"" was one of the best in the industry however recently the rules for mileage gain have been dramatically changed to the negative and former status customers are expelled by unfavourable new rules."
1742,,J Tinning,Australia,23rd March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Between Munich and London Heathrow. The flight was on time the aircraft (320) was clean and comfortable. The catering is good quality and staff friendly. Was good first flight with Lufthansa and would choose again.
1743,,M Peretti,Italy,23rd March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,LH 414 11/3/2015. I've been and still am a loyal flyer to LH for more than 10 years but now its network of connections (LH and Star Alliance in general) is getting less competitive and forcing me to evaluate alternatives: in the US I'm forced to fly with alternative airlines. In Italy where I live connections to AOI airport have been cut and now I'm frequently going SkyTeam. I'm not happy with this.
1744,,Crowther Alexander,Slovenia,20th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew from VCE to FRA and from FRA to DUB economy class ticket. The crew on both flights were extremely polite and kind. On the VCE to FRA flight we had to wait in the aircraft for around 45 minutes due to problems with snow in Frankfurt. Some people were worried that they would miss their connecting flights but the crew and flight attendants kept us informed about all delays and changes. I got my flight to Dublin on time and it also had a slight delay. I have flown with Lufthansa most of my life and I am very satisfied with the airline. The food however is like with all other European and American airliners if you fly on an economy class ticket.
1745,,Richard Connett,New Zealand,20th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,"LH903 - LHR/FRA - A320 - 27 Jan. The check-in service at LHR was exceptional and one of the best check-in experiences I have had. As I was a premium customer the agent gave me an exit row seat and kept the next seat to me vacant. The service changed for the worst in the departure lounge. First of all they announced boarding for business class and Star Alliance Gold customers. I skipped over to that line to board only to be hauled up by an abrupt and loud ground crew member to be told in front of everyone that ""we are only boarding business class and Gold Star Alliance customers"". I had pleasure in telling her I was a Star Alliance Gold Member (actually Elite with Air New Zealand) and I then boarded. In this day and age no one should ever presume that only people wearing Savile Row suits and Italian shoes are the Premium customers. The rest of the flight was typical LH clean plane efficient and professional cabin crew with pilots getting us there before time and baggage being unloaded within minutes."
1746,,Milan Grohmann,Czech Republic,20th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,no,2,LH 402 Mar 8 2015 from Frankfurt to Newark. There was a standard that on Star Alliance flights the gold members got following standard benefits on board. a) Priority boarding b) personal invitation on board by the steward c) free seat next to passenger's one to provide more comfort (if possible). On this flight everything was wrong. Boarding was chaotic there was no priority boarding. No invitation. The flight was not overbooked but stewardess seated another person next to me so she reduced my flight comfort significantly. She could have seated that person easily somewhere else. It didn't happen for the first time. The service standard of Lufthansa has decreased a lot during last 9 months.
1747,,F Biewer,Germany,20th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I recently experienced a great and very comfortable Business Class flight with Lufthansa from Munich to Miami. Perfect service very professional helpful and friendly crew. The food was delicious and a nice variety of wines was served. Everything very clean comfortable seat that was converted into a full flat bed. So I could get some hours of sleep. Very clean plane and technically in perfect shape as far as I a business person could see. Great service so I can highly recommend Lufthansa.
1748,,R Thut,Switzerland,20th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,6,MUC-TLS-MUC on March 12 and return March 16. The flight was operated by Lufthansa's CITY LINE with an E195. I love this aircraft. The crew to Toulouse were very nice and happy to passengers opposite on the way back. Presented themselves a little arrogantly. The service was a sandwich and a drink service. Fine with me. However they served the exact same sandwich on the way back. I am happy that Swiss will fly as of May 1 2015 directly to TLS so I don't have to fly to MUC to change.
1749,,Felicetti Riccardo,Italy,20th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,"Out of EWR and in in FRA on time. Nice welcome on board. Fine food and huge choice of on board entertainment. Nice to wake up with a ""good morning"" caress and a real Espresso."
1750,,O Benyehuda,United States,17th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,Flew Business Class from Newark to Stockholm and return to JFK both via Frankfurt. Outbound on 747-800. Beautiful plane and has a high tech feel. New Business Class is nice but somewhat cramped - the seats are very narrow and there is really no storage space. The angled seats puts your feet uncomfortably close to your neighbors. Service on board was very professional and attentive. The meal out of Newark was surprisingly good with an excellent fillet mignon but ground service was lacking - boarding was delayed by almost an hour after it was announced for unclear reasons and the lounge was crowded with terrible internet. Connecting flight on A321 - just economy seats for business class price. Nice service but terrible product. Return was supposed to be on United from Frankfurt but flight delayed for 7 hrs due to mechanical so switched to LH400. Again impeccable service but meal as is standard for Lufthansa out of Frankfurt barely edible - tough lamb with weird vegetables. Desert so small one needs a microscope to see it. The breads served were the best part of the meal. The biggest problem is Lufthansa's angled business class seat. The most uncomfortable business class seat in the air. The IFE system had very limited choices. We circled JFK due to a bad snow storm and then waited for gate forever - total delay of 2.5 hrs. but the crew kept everyone informed and were very nice. Bottom line - highly professional service with sub par cabins.
1751,,V Ladhani,Germany,17th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,yes,5,HAM-FRA-RIX: I have travelled this sector a couple of times in past few months and service has always been consistent although at times crew can be sour. All the flights were operated on time on standard A321 without AVOD. I am 189 cms tall and find LH seats hard but I somehow fit in cost cutting can be clearly seen. At all flights informative announcement from cabin. Toilets on LH can inconsistent dirty on some segments. On both flights to RIX crew ran out of sandwiches so we had to take leftover croissants. The crew are doing an acceptable job but they need to work on their snack service. This segment is 2 hours and has enough time to serve a decent snack and please also consider vegetarians. Even though I pay for a premium airline I always have to buy a salad or sandwich from the airport to eat inside the aircraft just because sandwiches are either with chicken or eggs. No vegetarian option and one can't even book a meal for long EU flights.
1752,,V Kini,United Arab Emirates,17th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,DXB-FRA BUD-FRA-DXB. Usually exclusively fly with Emirates but I'm glad I chose Lufthansa this time. Online check in worked like a charm and the bag drop counter was very fast. As the intercontinental flight was red-eye didn't get to properly check out the IFE but it looked very promising. Food was excellent very good taste indeed. Cabin crew were nothing exceptional but very good nonetheless. Seat on the A340-300 was quite comfortable and I got some good shut eye. Seats on the A320 BUD-FRA were a bit thin but can't complain as it's adequate for the short hop. All flights were perfectly on time and although we had a 1 hour connection in FRA on the return trip we had plenty of time. Overall very good first experience on Lufthansa!
1753,,T Eldem,Canada,17th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,LH475 from YUL to MUC on Airbus 333. Used the priority check-in for Star Alliance Gold and was served by a very efficient duo of agents. They moved me forward in the cabin and put me in a seat which had a good chance of having the neighbouring seat empty. It also provided extra legroom as it was in a transition row. Aircraft was spotless and bright and the pullback from the gate was on time. Service by FA's was efficient professional and attentive. Two choices of main course was offered for dinner and the food quality was good for Economy. There were several drink rounds throughout the overnight flight and breakfast was served prior to landing. IFE was expansive and offered a great choice of recent movies and other entertainment. Bathrooms were spacious bright and kept clean. Seats were as comfortable as one can expect in Economy and provided reasonable legroom. Flight arrived on time and we were kept informed by the captain at just the right points in the flight. Another great experience with Lufthansa they seldom disappoint.
1754,,J Egan,New Zealand,17th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,LAX-MUC on an A340-600 (newly reconfigured with Premium Economy). Had the aisle bulkhead in the front of economy. LOTS of legroom though the IFE and tray are both in the armrest (fine by me). Seat was very comfortable and I slept well. Crew were excellent as was the food. Got to watch 2 recent Oscar winning films in the IFE. I love the A340's having the economy class toilets downstairs. Wish LH flew directly to New Zealand: they would have my money every time.
1755,,Sebastian Nossing,Germany,17th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,no,3,I traveled from FRA to LAX on a brand new Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i. The plane itself was in great condition with a wide selection of entertainment programmes and friendly staff providing good service. But economy seating was absolutely not acceptable in terms of seat dimensions. I am a pretty average sized male (187cm 90kg) and my shoulder width was wider than the seat. Same goes for my seat neighbour which meant that we had to sit uncomfortably bent and twisted or get personal. The forward distance was so narrow that my face was only 5 inches from the back of the forward seat when it was moved fully backwards. I tried to avoid the whole thing by upgrading to Premium Economy but I learned that a regular Economy ticket was not eligible for an upgrade. Only Eco Flex tickets can be upgraded but they are so expensive that I would go straight to Business Class instead of buying one of them. Overall I am still wondering what all these bonus miles on my account are good for. Conclusion: When I have an alternative on a direct connection next time I will give the competitor a try. Lufthansa's problem aren't overpaid crews but a lack of respect to the needs of passengers.
1756,,Glenn Standish,Poland,9th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I flew from Frankfurt to Tokyo and back on am A340-300. Both flights were excellent with good efficient service and responsive in flight entertainment. The wifi (paid service) was excellent and really helped to pass the time during the long 11-12hr flights. One passenger had an eating disorder and for some reason there had a misunderstanding and Lufthansa didn't have a meal for them. I was very impressed how the chief purser went out of her way for the passenger offering him food from business class and at one stage even her own food! The outbound flight was delayed due to a technical malfunction just as we were taxiing to the runway. However was impressed with how Lufthansa handled this. The pilot kept us informed several times and we were only delayed by an additional hour. Overall I highly recommend Lufthansa!
1757,,K Fortwaengler,Germany,9th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,no,4,As large person (6ft 4in) it is almost impossible to sit in one of the standard economy class seats! I learnt that with the cheaper tickets a seat reservation is no longer possible. So even if you check in online (24 hours prior to the flight) only middle seats are available - absolutely impossible for people like me! I had luck that one person didn't check in so one of the seats with additional leg space was available. The crew supported me in this (the woman at the check-in told me that the seat maybe would be available and I should ask at the gate as I've arrived at the gate they already were informed). So this time leg space was no issue but if you don't like close contact to your neighbors you will not stay in the seat for a long time! You can't sit erect you have to buckle. I've spend more than 50% of the time walking around and chatting with the very friendly crew. For me (not paying an extra charge) this seat was OK. But for my neighbor who paid extra it was annoying - he like me was more walking around than sitting in the insufficient seat!
1758,,Arthur Mosher,United States,4th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,"I choose Lufthansa over other transatlantic carriers because I have and continue to experience excellent service even in the economy class. I do wish however that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a ""premium"" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the ""regular"" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good although the ""snack"" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights. United's service simply doesn't compare with Lufthansa's and their flights are frequently delayed or canceled."
1759,,Nissen Marina,Germany,4th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,LH 418 a very reliable airline. An improvement that they have introduced Premium Economy class. On this specific flight the crew offered water regularly. The inflight entertainment is a little outdated. A positive was the Hotspot / Internet access which allowed me to do some work.
1760,,W Veit,Germany,4th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,Economy FRA-ORD was ok in many ways on time good seats timely departure and arrival. However advance seat reservation (window seat at a cost of €25) did not allow do identify seats with TV boxes under the next seat thus restricting space. This should be indicated during the booking process like is possible with SWISS.
1761,,S Buchholz,Germany,4th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Had a 10hrs flight from LAX-FRA with this airline and the service at the airport was okay. I did online-check in 24hrs before so I only had to go to the bag drop counter. The line was very long so I had to wait a long time. The funny thing was that the check-in line was much faster. Boarding was fast. The impression I got of the crew was that they were very unfriendly and were very stressed. The seats were comfortable for a long flight. Leg space was okay if the front seat isn't reclined. A plus was the inflight entertainment a large selection of movies music TV shows and games. The food was better than average a choice between two dishes. I had the chicken which was okay for an onboard meal. Breakfast was an omelette with spinach and hash browns a plus is that you have a good choice of beverages and alcoholic drinks. All in all it was a nice flight with average food and stressed stewards. In the past service was much better.
1762,,O Hazan,United States,4th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,"IAD-IST (via FRA) in economy on February 21 2015. I arrived at IAD during a bad snowstorm. The gate counter showed the flight as ""on time"" until the 748 showed up 60m before the scheduled departure time. Departure was then delayed by 90 minutes. The American agents at the gate weren't very polished about it but not too bad either. They were able to give me my new arrival time in Istanbul (3.5h later than originally planned). We boarded but needed to de-ice and it took 2.5h between boarding and taking off. I am glad I had had a snack at IAD! The captain was frustrated and very apologetic throughout. This was my 2nd flight on LH 748 and although I love the Queen of the Skies the 748 economy cabin is not pleasant. It is very chopped up and you don't have that Wow feel you should have in a 747. I was on the first aisle seat behind the premium economy which means that the aisle abruptly narrowed and I was ""in the way."" Dinner was fine and the choice of entertainment was great. Because of the delay I had a rushed transfer at FRA where the passengers needed to take a bus to board (no jetway for the IST flight). The flight to IST on a spotless A320 was uneventful. Good lunch but no entertainment at all. All in all Lufthansa did well considering the storm. But on my way back Turkish Airlines and United were just as good if not a little better."

1765,,Devottam Sengupta,India,4th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,Business class on BCN-FRA-DEL. BCN-FRA flight was decent (same seats as economy nothing to write home about good breakfast warm service) but for some reason was parked halfway down the Rhine valley when it arrived in Frankfurt. Took over 40 minutes to make my connecting flight at literally the other end of the airport. For some reason Frankfurt airport staff thought it necessary for all buses to wait for all passengers to leave the aircraft before staring the long trek to the terminal instead of a bus starting off when full. FRA-DEL flight was on the A380 with the old style angled flat seats. Given that both of Lufthansa's supposedly downmarket brands (Swiss and Austrian) have better long haul business seats Lufthansa has no excuse for continuing with this substandard product. To add to the cost-cutting feel the portions of food served on the flight seemed smaller than those I've gotten in the past on LH. At least the IFE worked fine and has good choice and the staff tried hard to keep the passengers happy. Would recommend flying Lufthansa business only if flying on an aircraft with the new business class.
1766,,D Moore,United Kingdom,4th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Flew on LH 958 FRA/BHX on 22 February in business class. The cabin staff did not even bother to close the curtain separating business from economy throughout the entire flight that tells you everything you need to know about Lufthansa's incredibly poor short haul domestic product. I had transferred from a long haul flight where I experienced the new business product which is excellent. I guess the business cabin on short European flights is used mainly by connecting long haul business class passengers - surely nobody would actually pay to fly business on only a short haul flight at least not on LH group carriers.
1767,,Smedley Jenny,United Kingdom,4th March 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,"Birmingham to Venice 20/2/15. As a frequent traveller whose budget only stretches to economy class we were very impressed. Very efficient check in and friendly crew really enjoyed the complimentary snacks and drinks and disagree with other reviews stating ""not enough legroom"" in economy. We all had a very comfortable flight and will definitely fly with Lufthansa again."
1768,,Dinixo Geht,Germany,24th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,"LH475. Overall a good flight. Very full so no free seat at all in the cabin. Staff very friendly. Cabin very modern. I had requested an Asian vegetarian menu however it turned out as a ""normal"" tasteless vegetarian rice and vegetable. Staff tried and provided some veggie pasta which was ok. Overall satisfied with the flight."
1769,,Zoran Culig,Austria,24th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,LH 979 13th Feb 2015. DUB-FRA in Business Lufthansa Europe services greatly improved in 2014 and 2015. Very friendly cabin crew and the pilot provided detailed information about the flight. Optimal work conditions during the flight. For Lufthansa Business Class three different price levels are available so that cheaper options could also be purchased.
1770,,Richard Hattemer,Germany,24th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,FRA-BOG-FRA on A340-600. As often with Lufthansa I found the flights satisfactory but not outstanding. Airplane looked new the cabin was in good condition and clean (the bathroom less so at least after a few hours into the flights). Beverages were served several times selection and quality were good. Food was o.k. but nothing to rave about except for the very tasty passion fruit cream for dessert on the flight back and the chocolate in between. I am glad though that again there was a vegetarian option. Service was quite friendly and attentive. For a tall person though the space in Lufthansa's Economy Class is really sub-standard: narrow seats leg room barely alright if the person in front of you has the seat in an upright position but very uncomfortable if that is not the case. My seat neighbor who had a center seat could hardly get out of the row. The space on Avianca's A318 for a domestic flight before that was definitely more generous and did not feel as claustrophobic. The IFE touch- screen did hardly react on both flights. Changing the program was therefore difficult.
1771,,Erksson Jens,Sweden,24th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,LH 457 LAX-FRA 9th February. It was my first trip with a 747-8 and it was a great experience. I had a real good seat - 27K where I could feel comfortable and very good space to be an economy seat. Lufthansa always offers me a good service.
1772,,A Schaberg,Germany,24th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,3,LH429. The seat comfort in Economy Class is bad compared to other airlines. Even for people with a normal body height it is not comfortable to sit for 8-9 hours. Sleeping is nearly impossible due to steep position of seat back. Due to excellent reputation of airline I still tend to travel with LH and recommend to friends.
1773,,R Ingo,Germany,18th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Trip FRA-SIN and BKK-FRA on A380/A340 respectively. Friendly crew good service. IFE has improved too. New seats in economy are OK but seem of poor quality as the recline function was already faulty after not a very long-time in service. I always notice that the crew 'vanish' after their routine service.
1774,,Ford Alexander,Luxembourg,18th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,We flew FRA-SIN-FRA in business class. They have really improved their service offering. Now you get slippers and socks which does make perfect sense when you want to go to the restroom. They serve champagne in champagne glasses and finally serve espresso too. The crew to SIN was very friendly and courteous and took great care of us. On the return it was a little less overwhelming less smiles. IFE in general great more quality than quantity I prefer that. On return flight our screens didn't work and they didn't do much about it apart from suggesting we should sleep. Middle eastern Airlines really made a point and now all the others must follow if they want to stay in business. Advantage goes to LH their crews interact with customers .It's all a bit bland but what you see is what you get.
1775,,D Keipinger,Germany,12th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flight: LH430 FRA-ORD. Excellent crew good IFE very good food. Economy Seat could be improved.
1776,,Di Mugno Michael,Germany,12th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Washington Dulles to Frankfurt. 19/1/2015. My first time in Premium Economy and it's been fantastic! Its not as cheap as Economy Plus on United but you can't compare that! Far more leg space fantastic seats where you can nearly lay down as in Business Class food and drinks served with style and great taste! For my next trip I will book Premium Economy for sure. It's 100% worth it!
1777,,Krumm Christian,Germany,12th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,"LH475 Montreal - Munich. Almost fully booked. Seats (Economy) quite comfortable but a little more space would be great. Service nearly perfect very friendly staff. Catering very good (dinner) except the ""snack"" in the morning (sweet stuff). Lufthansa is getting better and better."
1778,,Grund Thomas,Germany,12th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,LH434 Munich to Chicago 26th January. Had multiple trips to the US with Lufthansa over the past couple of months and service timing and equipment was always perfect. Could recommend it fully but Economy seats should have a little more space.
1779,,Decker Alexander,Germany,6th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,LH460 22/1/15. We booked Lufthansa for our flight from Munich to Miami a 11.5h flight. We wanted to avoid an awkward flight with no space therefore we chose LH and paid more compared to other airlines. They say: there is no better way to fly. Honestly this was the poorest flight over the Atlantic. Absolutely no space to sit a domestic flight usually offers more space. The touchscreens almost were not controllable. You could touch them but they did not react so we could not really enjoy the inflight entertainment. The stewardess tried to help she was nice rebooted the system several times but it did not really work as it was to supposed to. Will never do it again.
1780,,L Richter,Germany,6th February 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,The crew on the reviewed flight to the USA was great - very attentive and always friendly which isn't self-evident with regard to Lufthansa. The food was ok but the portion was too small for such a long flight (~11.5 hrs). The seat is very uncomfortable (hard and small cushion) my back and posterior already hurt after sitting there for 2 hours. Nevertheless it was better than a regular seat in Economy Class since I had at least a bit of legroom because I paid extra for an Emergency Exit Seat. I think it is very inappropriate to charge that much money for an Emergency Exit Seat. Overall experience was ok but not great.
1781,,Benussi Patrizio,Germany,30th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 435 on 24th January 2015. Flight was very nice and punctual! Service very good! Business Class Lounge (of United) in Chicago is rubbish! Not really worth going there! No Flair no real comfort - just very cold and without any expression! Biggest disappointment on this trip! Otherwise the flight was good!
1782,,Puneck Holger,Germany,28th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,LH 797 Hong Kong-Frankfurt Jan 18 on B747-8. Really impressed by the new LH Premium Economy which I could use for the very first time. Check-in friendly and quick. Boarding efficient. On board a very friendly crew. Once I had taken my seat welcome drink was offered to all passengers in this section. Nice amenity kit at every seat. The seat is simply great much more space than in normal Economy big IFE-screen with huge entertainment options. This was one of the drawbacks of flying Lufthansa but they finally improved it. Meal service from a menu 3 main dishes to chose from. Well presented on fine china. Due to departure at midnight service very efficient but never looked stressed. Wanted to give us more time to sleep. The seat is very comfortable good enough to sleep for 6 hours or so. Of course can't compare with their new Business seats which are top notch. During the night staff came around with drinks and snacks. Breakfast could have been better in my opinion. But that's the only negative point. In all Lufthansa is getting a real premium carrier. Staff excellent efficient friendly and professional.
1783,,R Friess,Germany,28th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,LH 428 flight to Charlotte/USA was the introduction of new Premium Economy at this connection. Had a chance experiencing this new offer and was satisfied. Seat very spacious in economy and service upgraded compared to standard economy. A good option for the money having more room better service and comfort.
1784,,Michael Esser,Germany,23rd January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 457 1/15/15. My first time in Premium Economy. I will never fly business again. The leg space was great the seat did not incline like in business but still enough to enable me to sleep. The service was ok+ of course not like in business but still very good food and drinks were more than sufficient. I also have to mention the excellent service at the gate. I had been on the waiting list for an upgrade to business which had gone lost though. In premium economy there were only middle seats left which I didn't like. The attendant behind the desk looked into it and found a window seat for me. After some terrible experiences with other airlines (especially British Airways whose economy class has become a joke ever since they decided to divide their aircraft into five (!) different classes) this was an enjoyable experience.
1785,,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,23rd January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Flew to and from Sao Paulo via Frankfurt. Already written about the disastrous seat reservation system so I won't rant on about this here again. I would say though that it took no fewer than 4 people at Frankfurt to actually resolve our seating issues. In the end only the Flight Manager was able/willing/empowered to deal with it. The crew on all flights were to be fair very good and the food was fine too. Seats however were very uncomfortable on the B747 so I got little if any sleep on the long 11 hour flights. Also the IFE is terrible. I have a very varied and eclectic taste in TV music and film and found little to entertain me. And to top it all off Lufthansa left our bags in Frankfurt en route back to London and can't seem to drag themselves to get them back to us in Southampton until tomorrow even though by their own admission they have now arrived on a later flight. Appalling.
1786,,B Niemeijer,Netherlands,21st January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,LH428 11/1/2015. Flight MUC to CLT with a small 330 / 300 Airbus. Flight was almost fully booked but plane was not parked at the gate but parked on the tarmac. Had to travel with busses. Plane was already delayed and extra de frosting made the delay even bigger. Entertainment system needed re booting several times. Crew were friendly. When you fly a lot like I do you expect a bit more variety of food - not always chicken with pasta.
1787,,H Mutschler,Germany,21st January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew Cologne to Munich and back on some day. Early morning flight was on time Crew were nice and offered chocolate cookies before take off. Flight only 50 minutes but got a nice coffee with milk and one juice. Captain informed about flight details. In Munich gate was with jetfinger and since the plane was not full it just took a few minutes to deplane. Love LH over Germanwings too bad they do not fly from Cologne to Hamburg.
1788,,Ursula Bonfiglioli,United States,21st January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 428. Flight and connections were very good. I would improve entertainment on board (old movies) and food could be better! Overall they are good!
1789,,Grimme Franco,Italy,21st January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,LH491 January 10 2015. I have been a senator member for many years and since 1998 I flew practically only with this airline to my complete satisfaction. In the years I also became an hon club member thanks to my very frequent flight trips. Now I am retired person I cannot afford to fly business and I regularly fly 3-4 times a year either to Brazil or USA to visit my son and daughter. I always book well in advance my flights (the last one of December 16 2014 was booked on June 6 2014). To be more comfortable (I have a knee problem) I always try to book emergency seats and this seems to be almost impossible. I would like to see the airline more sensible to this subject.
1790,,Grassegger Hannes,United States,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 418 1/9/2015. Great service a beautiful new plane competent and friendly staff - had a wonderful experience going from FRA to IAD in the business cabin of a 747-8 on Lufthansa!
1791,,F Bertoni,Italy,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,2,yes,7,Sao Paulo-Frankfurt in Premium Economy operated with a packed 748. Flight left late but made it perfectly on time. I always fly this route with Turkish Airlines in Comfort class (Premium Economy) but this time I decided to give Lufthansa and its new product a try. Seat: absolutely adequate and wide enough. There is plenty of room for your legs. It is ok for getting some sleep. I liked the amenity kit distributed. What I really did not like it's the absolute absence of privacy as the Premium Economy seats are actually not separated in any way from regular Economy class. Very good (and upgraded) IFE. The welcome drink despite very basic (juice) is a nice touch. Cabin crew as always with Lufthansa is efficient similing and polite. But let me spend some words on the food: almost inedible. It is actually the same food you would get in Economy class but served in china plates. Portion are getting every time smaller and food is almost tasteless. The price paid was quite high - overall not the best value for money. I'm afraid Lufthansa lost me on this route as I will keep flying Turkish Airlines Comfort class. Generally speaking Lufthansa remains a reliable airline.
1792,,T Persson,Sweden,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,yes,6,"FRA-IAD with Lufthansa. I was upgraded to ""Premium Economy"" due to Senator status and a full plane so they bumped ""upwards"". It was a new 747-800 so the screens were OK and picture quality good. Positives: Better food than regular economy. Better legspace and seat pitch than regular economy. Negatives: Lousy headphones same as regular economy so could not hear the movie properly. Premium economy cabin was ""messy"". Strange sharing with regular economy in 4 rows before Premium and approx 8 rows behind in mid section. So premium was in the middle of regular economy so it did not feel special in any way it was just as flying regular economy but with better legroom. Service level was same as regular economy due to the location of the cabin. I don't think it is worth the extra cost (600 Euro more for round trip FRA-IAD) for so little extra comfort. If LH reaches Thai Airways premium levels then it is worth the extra money."
1793,,K Watzinge,Germany,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,,3,yes,5,LH460 12/16/2014. It was very cold in the cabin during the flight. The plane was very noisy. The seats were uncomfortable - the upper part of it pushed the head uncomfortably forward. The bun offered was dry and tasteless. The cabin crew were very nice and the inflight entertainment excellent!
1794,,W Michael,United States,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Munich to Boston A330-300. New Business Class has finally arrived in most of the LH planes. In general I like the 180d-flat seat biggest drawback compared to other good business seats is the missing space for e.g. a laptop adjacent to the seat which superior seats from their other brands OS/LX offer you so you always have to use the foldaway table instead. Despite a fully booked C service was very efficient crew very attentive (and professional as always on LH). Entertainment screen is top of shelf. Plane was a little late and some people that had tight connection flights were fetched directly after arrival which is the efficiency LH is known for.
1795,,Marcus Nyberg,Sweden,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,9,Stockholm - Munich - Lisbon return. Everything worked out perfectly on this trip. The planes were in good condition the service was excellent and the food was better than expected. The short stop in the clean and efficient Munich airport was a nice break.
1796,,Marcus Nyberg,Sweden,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,2,yes,6,Stockholm - Frankfurt - Dallas. This time the Lufthansa experience was not as impeccable as I am used to. On the long flight during the day from Frankfurt to Dallas the IFE system never started up. This made the journey feel a bit longer than the 10 hours it actually took. Apart from that the service the food and the comfort was very good. Without asking for it I was also offered a very generous amount of frequent flyer points as compensation a few weeks afterwards.
1797,,D Christian,Switzerland,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,FRA-SFO: First Class Terminal in Frankfurt is very elegant. Onboard service very good. Professional crew. Quality of food and drinks very high. The minus was the arrival at SFO: No separate lane for immigration. The bags from all passengers (it was an A380) came on one belt - totally chaotic.
1798,,F Livi,Denmark,19th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,LAX-FRA LH457 7 Jan 2014 (LAX) and 8 Jan 2014 (FRA). I choose Lufthansa pretty often since I like their competence services flexibility regarding the luggage and their on-time flights. The aircraft's I have flown with were mostly in good to excellent conditions. There is often a good communication from the captain about the flight conditions and so on. Friendly and efficient staff. Sometimes fares could be a little expensive but it is easy to find interesting prices. I would definitely recommend this airline to everybody.
1799,,M Schnaufer,Austria,14th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Vienna - Frankfurt - Buenos Aires (and back): Web check-in worked fine got my reserved seat in the rear of the B747-8. The feeding flight to Frankfurt was uneventful the small snack was okay I also like that you can have a beer on shorthaul flights. The walk to the departure gate was very long but that's not the fault of LH. Flight left Frankfurt on time but arrived late due to the very long flight time of 14 hours (resulting from bad weather over the Atlantic Ocean). Food was okay but less in quantity. I frankly do not understand why airlines cut costs by reducing the amount (and the quality) of food. At least you get alcoholic beverages. Entertainment is now great with a lot of movies/shows to select. I could also find some rest during this 14 hours flight. Unfortunately flight attendants did not make their rounds with beverages that often. Breakfast was very poor! Lufthansa is a reliable and professional airline they usually get you to your destination on time. But I am not really thrilled flying them.
1800,,W Staab,United States,14th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,yes,3,JFK-Frankfurt-Budapest then Vienna-Munich-JFK. Tried to book seats online after booking flight but now Lufthansa only allows seats to be booked online by paying a fee (amount depending on the seat chosen) until 23 hours prior to the flight time when online booking of remaining seats is free. First aggravation. Start was delayed 2.5-3 hours due to late arrival of aircraft at JFK- no weather problems all other European flights left on time only this Lufthansa flight was late. The plane was a 747-8 not full had 3 seats for myself. Food not of high quality but the service throughout was exemplary - superb. Arriving in Frankfurt of course missing connecting flight to Budapest with a 4.5 wait for next flight. Asked Lufthansa in Frankfurt if I could have use of a lounge during the long wait and was outright denied that privilege though they gave me a 10 Euro certificate for something to eat in the meantime but as we had passed customs there were no restaurants available in that area only snack bars so had a torte. Flight to Budapest was routine sandwich and drinks. Luggage arrived timely in Budapest. Return to JFK with short flight Vienna to Munich (drinks but no snacks) - then Airbus 330 Munich to JFK which was quite cramped as to seating even on the aisle. Food barely passed muster (metal cutlery though) as Lufthansa has declined dramatically in their culinary department but again the Flight attendants were magnificent many drink runs and staff courtesy and organization superior to both Swissair and Austrian flown on similar routes in the last months (Austrian has the best food of the 3 airlines but being owned now by Lufthansa that too has declined considerably from a few years ago). The new 747-8 had a quieter flight than most other planes flying transatlantically. Without the inability to book seats earlier than 23 hours before each flight and the very late departure of the flight to Frankfurt from JFK I would rank Lufthansa higher than a 3 - probably an 8 despite uninteresting bland meals.
1801,,A Althani,Qatar,14th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,This was my return flight from Paris CDG to DOH via FRA in Business Class the flight from CDG to FRA was on an Airbus A321 was comfortable with prompt efficient service all on time though I was troubled that at check in although I explained to the staff that I had fragile glass ornaments but they refused to put a handle with care stickers on my bags. The portion from Frankfurt to Doha was on an Airbus A330 with the new business class which was very nice and excellent service with wonderful meal selection I really liked the Bavarian Goose. Though the connection time was very short just one hour but all our bags made it through which was also very nice.
1802,,N Rieskamp,Germany,14th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,4,yes,9,Trip from Frankfurt to Dublin in Business Class on A319 (no connecting flight). You get what you expect. The weak point is the seating of NEK as its an Economy Class Seat with the middle-Seat blocked. Seat pitch and space are not luxury the recline is ridiculous and it feels somewhat cheap. There is no IFE and no power socket what was not so important on this 110 minutes flight. Nevertheless I would spend the money again as the rest was really ok.
1803,,M Schnaufer,Austria,14th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Vienna - Frankfurt - Buenos Aires (and back): Web check-in worked fine got my reserved seat in the rear of the B747-8.

1804,,Ralf Bostedt,Germany,14th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Basically uneventful flight. Relaxed and stress free boarding. Perfectly on time (both departure and arrival). However cabin staff (on my side of the aisle) was in training. (Hopefully). Forgot things full command of English or German deficient. Couldn't answer question on what the food is. All acceptable however not the lack of friendliness. That is unusual at in my experiences as frequent travelers with Lufthansa. (Senator/Gold status).
1805,,Hoang Van Hiep,Vietnam,11th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,9,LH772 FRA-BKK with A340-300 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all for Economy Class you can't do much better than that. LH seats seems to be bigger than in the past a little bit harder but more spacious in length. The inflight entertainment is excellent with touch screen 8' monitor quite good quality. The only complain is that it shows the program of December 2014 even we started the trip on the first 2015. The steward promised to check and answer but he never returned.
1806,,Hoang Van Hiep,Vietnam,11th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,LH779 SIN-FRA with A380 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. The C class seat near the window got extra storage on the side and is very convenience. The only problem is the remote control under your arm rest some times you unintentionally hit the remote control and your film stops. I like the A380 very much.
1807,,M Riccardo,Italy,11th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew Venice-Frankfurt-Delhi on December 28. Initial flight was supposed to be a day earlier so I missed my connection in FRA and was put on a Lufthansa flight to Delhi rather than Air India which was nice. VCE-FRA was delayed by 2hours and I only managed to make it because FRA-DEL was also delayed. FRA airport although I was there for less than an hour was an atrocious experience. I had to speed like crazy to make the flight and still had to go through security one more time and they were extremely rude unprofessional and in no way understanding. This is surely not Lufthansa's fault but it did ruin my trip. Flight to Delhi was on their A380 which I adore. Leg room was fair food was decent although they only had vegetarian options. FAs were extremely polite and professional and always asked if we wanted any drinks throughout the flight. My issue was mostly related to IFE which was not what I expected from LH. Overly German focused and pretty dull overall. Regardless I surely would fly them again.
1808,,C Teed,United States,11th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,yes,4,I flew on the new 747-8 that Lufthansa put into service from LAX to Frankfurt. The cabin was clean and the entertainment system functioned flawlessly. I was seated in coach somewhat in the middle section. The service was prompt and pleasant. Although I don't eat airline food the cabin crew completed service and quickly quietly cleaned it up. The aircraft itself was quiet and the lighting system was much more pleasant (L.E.D.) than the standard type. Overall better than many other transatlantic flights I've made.
1809,,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,5th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,Tried to book seats online for our impending journey to Brazil. Spent an age going through all the information and was poised to spend a small fortune on allocated seats and then found I started getting spurious (but in no way informative) error messages referring me to a (German) telephone number. I decided after several attempts to use the Lufthansa webchat and a nice but not very helpful woman took me all the way through the very laborious process only to inform me after all that their website is not compatible with Google Chrome. So my Sister tried it for me on her PC and it failed yet again. Half the population uses Google Chrome! Lufthansa you really need yo try harder than this. Appalling start to our first ever Lufthansa experience. I am rating the airline on the various categories listed here as it won't let me submit a review without doing so.
1810,,C Fox,Australia,5th January 2015,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH1392M Frankfurt - Prague. On time departure bussed to aircraft on remote stand. Efficient and friendly crew and a lovely breakfast served despite the flight being only 40 minutes.

1812,,G Spiros,Sweden,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,ARN-MUC 17 Dec one-way. Full flight on a A320. Service was a bit rushed. Everything was commenced in the first 20 minutes and then nothing only if you ask for it. A small sandwich was served and drinks. Crew were friendly and nice. A standard intra-european flight.
1813,,Simon Aleksander,Poland,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight LH475 from Montreal to Munich on 12/12/2014. A bit delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft from Munich however the delay was almost made up in Munich what allowed me to catch the connecting flight. Appreciate the upgrade to Business Class as Gold Star Alliance member - service great as usual no any problems. Recommend LH for long haul flights - even in the Economy Class the seat is quite comfortable and passenger safety and satisfaction is always of top priority.
1814,,John Vollbrecht,United States,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,no,4,December 2 2014 from Dulles flight 419. Destination was Frankfurt Germany. Upgraded on the return flight which was Frankfurt to Dulles on Lufthansa 418 on December 13 2014. Lufthansa has always been our preferred carrier but the new seating in economy was on the verge of intolerable. The way the seat attaches to the floor greatly limits what you can carry on there is no foot room. Knee room to the next row is minimal especially if the person in the seat in front leans back. The seats are narrow and not comfortable. They are squeezed together so much that the seat pocket in front of you can barely hold one bottle of water. Food has greatly degraded over the past few years. I feel degraded by being in economy class. It is insulting to pay for such a horribly uncomfortable trip. I felt like baggage being crammed into the baggage hold and that I had no value as a customer. Our return flight was much better as we unhappily upgraded to economy plus but we greatly resented being forced to pay more money just to have a seat that was adequate for an overseas flight.
1815,,N Kohut,United States,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flight Munich - Washington (LH414). Great seat big TV screen modern and easy to use controls nice materials everywhere. The seat was comfortable and roomy (I was in the window seat). Entertainment was good. Food was also good and a fair choice. Plenty of beverages. Crew was wonderful flight attendants were attentive and friendly. The only thing I would recommend - some more privacy. But overall I had a very good experience.
1816,,Egbert Schroeer,United States,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,LH491 LH431. Whenever we fly between Germany and the US we fly Lufthansa. The seat comfort in Economy class seats is a pain. Business or First Class I can recommend without hesitation. The service is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! We had the seats at the emergency exit which we take if we have to fly Economy as Senator without extra charge as a standard passenger with extra charge. The space you have in this seat is limited the only plus is the leg room but people who try to go to the bathroom step into it hit your legs etc. Wondering why there is no Economy Plus as an option.
1817,,Fink Erich,Germany,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight LH444 from FRA to ATL booked in ECO because our company travel policy does not allow Business but operational upgrade to C (based on my status as LH-Senastor) because the main cabine was full and C not even 50 % occupied. Plane was equipped with the new business class seats I like them very much. The food was excellent and the wine selection very nice. All in all I had a very relaxed flight and arrived in Atlanta right on time.
1818,,J Harston,Serbia,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,4,Lufthansa is getting tired and it shows. I have flown 73 times with Lufthansa in the last 7 years. My flights BEG - FRA - ADDIS (via Jeddah) and return business class were very disappointing. Frankfurt - Addis is a long flight. Old aircraft old tilting seats old films old system unimaginative food no difference on the way back. Crew change in Jeddah swapped one good cheery crew for another.
1819,,M Tushishvili,France,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,I had the flight Paris-Tirana-Paris via Munich last month. Lufthansa offers very good European product. Both flights arrived on time and Lufthansa provides nice clean aircraft's with very friendly cabin crew. I am very much pleased with the generous leg room in comparison with low cost companies. This is very much appreciated! In terms of the food I have only one comment since Lufthansa gives sandwiches which used to be very tasty. Now they gave us the cheese sandwich which was full of unidentified cream and mayonnaise. It was so stodgy and unpleasant. I hope that the management will make appropriate actions to distribute healthy simple food in the future. Overall Lufthansa is my first choice and it is recommended without hesitation for European routes.
1820,,Simon Aleksander,Poland,31st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight LH475 from Montreal to Munich on 12/12/2014.

1822,,Tercon Bojan,Singapore,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,I adore Lufthansa's short-haul business class product. On this short 90 min flight from Munich to Amsterdam onboard an Embraer E90 the service was friendly yet professional the seat very comfortable and the food superb! The presentation is sophisticated and the quality excellent.
1823,,Bassoli Denisley,United States,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight LH 490 from Frankfurt to Seattle Dec/5th/2014. The First Class lounge was a very good a first class service in full - reception attendants and attention breakfast food seating space for working Wi-Fi. Passport control was taken care and being driven to the gate was a nice touch. Inflight very relaxing courteous attendants continued and food were really first class quality and quantity wise. Flight entertainment could be slight better real bed was excellent working room as well. Maybe bigger pillows would complement. All in all excellent first class.
1824,,Ayman Ilham,United Kingdom,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Had 2 flights MAN-MUC-RUH on 13th December 2014. First flight was LH-2501 from Manchester to Munich in an Airbus A321. No entertainment screens but this was only a two hour flight so I didn't mind. However the staff service was excellent and I got served a decent sandwich plus coffee and coke. Seats were okay for the short flight. Transferred at Munich Airport which was very neat and clean with a good bus ride from the plane to the terminal. The next flight LH-608 from Munich to Riyadh in an Airbus A330 (five hours) was the real deal! Seats weren't exactly the most comfortable out of all planes I've been on but it was good enough! Entertainment screens were quite unresponsive and not much of my interest but I have my iPod so I didn't mind. Managed to watch 2 episodes of Big Bang Theory and my sister watched Harry Potter (she was really happy that there were 5 Harry Potter movies available on the flight). Again excellent staff service (they smiled a lot for an added bonus) and I was surprised to get a really tasty meal (with Halal meat). Really well done for a non-middle-eastern airline! I felt completely relaxed throughout the flight!
1825,,Z Culig,Austria,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,LH 997 AMS-FRA service was much better compared to other European airlines on a short flight. Snack was served and drinks offered two times. Crew very professional and helpful. Flight was on time and it seems that Lufthansa improved considerably after some criticisms published 2 years ago.
1826,,Michael Thumm,Germany,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LH431. Whenever I fly between Germany and the US I try to fly Lufthansa. Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation. The service at Lufthansa is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! Also the food is good and they still offer wine and beer.
1827,,F Heinemann,United States,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,5,One of the tightest seat pitches I've seen on a long-haul flight (Premium Economy not offered on this route). Cabin constantly too cold. Crew was relaxed and friendly at the beginning but less so at the end. Food a very mixed bag. No sleeping masks or any other give aways. Only upside: Entertainment system of the slightly better version without this clunky old-school remote control but a decent touch screen. On arrival we had a tarmac position (at Munich!) and had to take buses to get to the terminal something that feels odd on a long-haul flight.
1828,,A Althani,Qatar,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew from Doha to Paris connecting in Frankfurt the brand new product with the slightly angled flat bed seats was offered on this A330-300 on the Doha to Frankfurt sector but I was told that not all flights on this route have the new product the seats are comfortable in the sitting and reclining position but not long enough for me when it is turned into a bed. The foot rest was very narrow the IFE screen was big but the movie and TV selection was not too big. Food was good and the portions where generous I enjoyed the crepe for breakfast no amenity kit was offered. Flight attendants were professional when needed they were present but otherwise they did not bother you when watching a TV program or a movie as does happen on other airlines. The flight from Frankfurt to Paris was on time comfortable and all our bags came through.
1829,,S Toljan,United States,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,I took a flight from Boston to Munich. As it is quite common with this airline the plane was in impeccable condition and practically new however the space - or lack thereof - in economy class is a bit extreme. I think the German engineers went overboard and squeezed a few too many rows into that bird. My inflight entertainment system worked fine but my wife's next to me didn't. The flight attendant told her 2 or 3 times that she would look into it and reboot the system but then she never did. Nothing major but a little more attention would have been nice.

1831,,Jens Praet,Italy,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,no,2,Flight LH797 (Dec 11 2014) from Hong Kong to Frankfurt in economy class I don't have a frequent flyer status (yet) however I try to be loyal to one company. New Boeing 747-8 in economy - you get what you paid for I always say - but due to my unpleasant experience below some observations that should be taken into consideration. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and the given space on the 747-8 feels incredibly cramped - Lufthansa's smaller airplanes are controversially far more spacious - I get they want to squeeze in as many passengers on the plane but on a +12 hrs flight you don't want to feel like a sardine in a can! Hostesses not attentive in general. In the future I will rather fly with Lufthansa's sister company Swiss Airlines which I personally find of a much better service.
1832,,Weissig Thomas,Germany,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,LH 419: I really enjoy traveling with Lufthansa for business I travel first or business class with my family we normally travel economy class. I really must say that I get the impression that economy is getting tighter with the years. The airlines offer much more space. Business and first I can recommend without hesitation.
1833,,R Gnanadesikan,United States,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew LH 419 on Dec 4th from Washington DC to Frankfurt Germany. The seats in the first class cabin were excellent. The service was excellent and the meal including the wine choices were superb. It is easier to get some sleep with the flat bed seats. I have traveled extensively with Lufthansa since 1991.
1834,,Fueglister Daniel,Switzerland,22nd December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,LH491. Airline and its service were very good for the price paid. Aircraft was renewed in economy (seats TV) which was very good. Food comparable to other European carriers.
1835,,B Borg,Norway,18th December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Oslo-Munich-Berlin / Berlin-Frankfurt-Oslo. Convenient schedules good and efficient service almost throughout. It was worth the premium over flying with another company. The boarding at Munich was the only thing that could have been better - the flight was delayed by about 30 minutes and boarding was somewhat chaotic. Definitely looking forward to my next Lufthansa flights.
1836,,R Jakab,Germany,18th December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LH456. Had the opportunity to fly LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles in Economy (normally I fly business). Was impressed by the overall high standard (the new B-747 I guess) and inflight entertainment is top of the tops. Small disappointment in food and beverage: Food: overall quality good chicken run out two rows before us so pasta only choice. In addition I do not understand why proper bread is not served instead of this white thing that resembles bad quality (Germany has good bread) Beverage: fail to understand why you get 2nd rate prosecco / sparkling and wines. Furthermore non-alcoholic beer was not available on flight. That is cost-saving on the wrong level in my opinion.
1837,,Hessing Frank,Germany,10th December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,2,yes,4,LH 465 from Orlando to Frankfurt on Nov 9th 2014. Despite their marketing campaign on many Lufthansa flights to the US and elsewhere there are still the old business class seats installed. I was on the Orlando - Frankfurt flight. Those seats are not good. Hard not good for sleeping not 180 degree flat but an inclined S form. Other airlines offer a much better business class for less money and on my next US flight I will definitely choose another airline if I find out that the airplane has the old seats. Lufthansa tickets in business class are generally high priced. so I would expect 180 degree seats. Service staff though is very well trained professional and food quality is good.
1838,,Epple Frank,Germany,10th December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,STR-FRA-GIG and GRU-MUC (business) -STR. STR-FRA very long bus transport from parking area to terminal. Long walk in FRA to terminal C nice lounge for waiting until boarding. Flight to GIG on 744 acceptable seating comfort. Food and drink offered were ok for economy. GRU-MUC on A346 in Business good food good service seat not that comfortable this time - still some hours of rest. IFE some nice films but very limited selection. Final leg MUC-STR very limited space in overhead bins - not even room for my hand luggage backpack. Luggage arrived one day later as it hadn't made connection in GRU.
1839,,Tercon Bojan,Singapore,10th December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,The 747-800 is my favourite plane in the Lufthansa fleet for it has their new lie-flat business class seat which was much appreciated on this 13 hour flight from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt. However I was very angry that the IFE did not work in my seat. Despite three attempts to reset it. Kaput! Not exactly satisfying when you pay premium $$ for a seat on a long-haul flight. The onboard wifi was also broken. I do have to say though that the purser came to apologize to me and she did a great job in explaining the situation re all the technical difficulties. Was appreciated. The food presentation and choices were excellent despite the flight attendants' initial insistence on speaking German to me even when I repeatedly asked them a question in English. Liked flight info and map.

1842,,Siva Krish,Canada,10th December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,Chennai to FRA. It was a old 747 flight the IFE screen was very small and useless no touch screen. There was no great selection of movies unless you know German. I wish I carried iPad. The FA's were rude not interested in customer service. For the 10 hour flight from Chennai to Frankfurt first 8 hours they serve nothing other then two rounds of juice. Just before landing a small light breakfast. Seats were cramped. I was disappointed with LH and will not fly again.
1843,,Christian Sage,Germany,4th December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,LH410 from Munich to JFK on October 10 2014. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all for Economy Class you can't do much better than that.
1844,,Denzil Bourne,United Kingdom,4th December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,LHR-MUC-LHR. A321 both ways. LH2479 and LH2470. Outbound was very full. So much so I had to put my weekend hand luggage under the seat in front. Crew where friendly and professional. Inbound less busy. Leg room was sufficient for a short flight and the snack and drink was fresh. On time departure inbound but we were bussed from the jet to the terminal at LHR.
1845,,W Bilofsky,United States,1st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,no,2,SFO-FRA on 28 October on a 380 in the Business Class torture seats. Good flight otherwise but neither my wife or I could get any sleep in these horrible seats.
1846,,Carriglio Mirco,Italy,1st December 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,Flight FRA-CAI in business class. It was the worst travel I've ever done. The airplane was a A320 but seats in business class were like economy and considering this is a 4 hours flight this not good. No IFE on board neither shared screens or PTV. I wouldn't recommend LH for these medium haul routes.
1847,,B Baldi,United States,25th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,Flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt on AB A380 aircraft clean food OK staff OK. Seat lousy - no legroom and uncomfortable. Armrest on aisle seat would not lower making it hard to leave the seat. Staff didn't know how to fix the problem. In-flight entertainment system next to useless because of unresponsive touch screen and one audio channel not working. Aircraft temperature cold to the point of requiring a jacket be worn at all times. On connecting flight to Berlin Luft. gate staff did not announce gate change in English so confusion resulted among waiting passengers who didn't speak German or missed the change on the electronic screen. Flight from Munich to San Francisco on AB A340 departed late because of baggage handling problem. Aircraft clean but temperature again cold and seat comfort worse than A380. In flight entertainment center barely working because of slow finicky touch screen and static in audio. Food OK not good just OK. Before taking Luft. again I will be sure to shop around for a better choice even if it means paying more.
1848,,Matthew Hollingshead,United States,25th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Munich to Chicago 19 Nov 2014 flight 434. Lufthansa is efficient and I always prefer flying Lufthansa. Airline staff are generally courteous. Seat comfort and space are excellent. Inflight movie selection was a bit uninteresting. One slight problem I paid extra for aisle exit seats but did not receive these on the return flight likely because I was forced to accept a flight change after the initial ticket was bought.
1849,,J Comissiong,Germany,20th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,17/10/2014 LH 754 FRA-BLR (Business Class). 2/11/2014 LH 755 BLR-FRA (Business Class). My travel partner couldn't have his meal choice fulfilled on-board twice! FRA-BLR and on the return leg BLR-FRA. The seats on the new B-748 were comfortable however my personal reading light did not function and I could not get the wifi access. There was enough space and more than enough to eat on board. The return leg was on an old B-744. The seats were not as comfortable as the newer aircraft and the IFE system was a bit limited regarding film and TV selection.
1850,,M Petr,Germany,20th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,,,1,no,2,"As LH Senator I have repeatedly booked a seat for my flights and repeatedly the seat reservation was cancelled. The seat booking system is not working at all. Estimate 75% of cases the seat cancellation is performed without any background - it is very disappointing. Flight LH2023 is a classical example of another incomprehensible situation - nearly every day the ""business class"" (which in LH's case is nothing but economy divided by curtain from the rest of the plane) is extended till row 12 making 48 business seats while occupation is 3 - 5 ""business"" passengers. Remaining travellers are squeezed in the back while front section is entirely empty. Another trick is to extend the ""business class"" for 24 hours to row 19 remove all forward seats reservations and then return back to the original configuration. Why they do it is a mystery to me. LH obviously don't like their status customers in the front of the aircraft."
1851,,R Dunigan,Canada,20th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,no,7,"LH471 YYZ to FRA en route to Marrakech. Usual LH experience: on time departure and arrival clean and orderly aircraft competent and polite cabin crew mediocre entertainment selection. Sadly the usual LH experience in seating as well. When is the ""old"" Business Class seat going to disappear? Probably the most uncomfortable C class seating I encounter."
1852,,Kris Mani,United Kingdom,20th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,"Flew EDI-FRA-ZRH. The flight from Edinburgh to Frankfurt was perfect on time with great in-flight service. As it arrived earlier than the scheduled time we were transported to the terminal by a bus. The second leg from Frankfurt to Zurich was delayed by 45 minutes due to an unknown reason. Again we were transported by a bus to the B737. Here is where the entire staff and crew showed their effectiveness. The flight duration was cut short to 40 min from the original 55 min. Even in such a short duration we were offered chocolates and drinks. I could simple describe their service in one word ""excellent""."
1853,,J Comissiong,Germany,20th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,17/10/2014 LH 754 FRA-BLR (Business Class). 2/11/2014 LH 755 BLR-FRA (Business Class).

1854,,Patel Niri,United Kingdom,20th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew MAN-MUC-DEL return in Business Class. Lounge in MAN is ok - typical regional airport lounge. Warm croissants. Breakfast on flight was ok - had ordered Asian veg. Service good. The long haul was a pleasant surprise. I'm 6ft tall and managed to get zero sleep on a flight to Mumbai from Frankfurt 7 years ago and that was my last flight with LH. The new Business class was a pleasant surprise. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Amenity kit is good. The seats are a huge improvement on the sloping beds. I managed to get a few hours sleep too. If you sit by the window you may find it a bit cramped. I switched to an aisle on the way back and this wasn't so cramped. Will use them again for Delhi especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food I forgive them. Will fly LH again for value and comfort.
1855,,Andrew Noble,United Kingdom,20th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I have to report an excellent journey JNB-FRA-LCY. New refurbished Business cabin on the A380 is very comfortable and a lovely decent sized pillow on which to sleep. Lie flat seat/bed is good but could be a bit narrow at shoulder level. However I managed 5-6 hrs sleep which is unusual for me on a lon flight. Food delicious especially on my outbound FRA-JNB sector Roast Goose which was perfect! Crew on all sectors were friendly and professional and the transit through FRA was a breeze. I would advise people to choose seats at rear of the 380 upper deck pref. row 26/27 as LH serve their food from the rear moving forward so you'll always have a full menu choice if seated here. A lovely travelling experience with an airline that maintains its pedigree.
1856,,S Sebastian,Poland,17th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,5,Regular LH410 flight good food and inflight entertainment as usual only problem was the freezing temperature onboard. Staff tried to increase it during the flight unsuccessfully.
1857,,Stephan Becker,Austria,12th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Good airline with good service and modern planes. Unfortunately not all planes have new seats but the new seats make a real difference! Fortunately the Washington - Munich flight had the new equipment. Food and drink offer is very good if not exceptional.
1858,,Demet Erdogan,Germany,12th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Flight from FRA-IST. Cabin crew service is okay for a European carrier. Smiling faces welcomes you on boarding until the end of the flight. Very attentive and skilled. Seating and entertainment not the best still bearable for a short flight but can't imagine these standards for +5 hours. Lunch provided was delicious however not many choices on offer. Overall a good flight with only minor draw backs.
1859,,K Lam,Malaysia,12th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,1,Oct 19 LH783 a group of us travelled to France in transit at Frankfurt Airport. Our confirmed seatings were all messed up despite we have booked this in Feb 14. It took us 40 minutes at KLIA Lufthansa counter to sort this out - each couple were seated together but the group had to split up. On our return leg (7 Nov 14) our group confirmed seats were again messed up despite reconfirming the seat 3 days before our departure with Lufthansa Malaysia. The check in counter staff was not helpful nor friendly at CDG airport to help us to reassign our seats so that each couple could sit together but the group was split up again. The return flight (Paris to Frankfurt LH1043) was re-timed later by 20 minutes but we were not informed and the flight arrived late at Frankfurt. So we had to run for our connecting flight to KL. There were no Lufthansa Staff at the gate to provide assistance.
1860,,Parag Narkhede,India,11th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,I traveled with my family on LH 768 from FRA to PNQ on 7th November 2014. It was a really good travel experience for us. Very comfortable and convenient too. Seats are comfortable same as any other regular Lufthansa flights. Landing at Pune for Puneites is far better than to Mumbai saving a lot of time in immigration process and travelling from Mumbai to Pune. Its really great to fly direct to Pune from Europe and credit to Lufthansa and PrivatAir.
1861,,G Slater,United Kingdom,11th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,LHR-FRA-JNB in economy. Short flight from London to Frankfurt satisfactory with good snack and drink pleasant attendants. Transfer at Frankfurt seamless to the A380 to Johannesburg - gone are the days of long walks through the lengthy corridors of Frankfurt. Very comfortable seats and service on A380. Cabin crew very responsive and friendly. Food satisfactory. Return was CPT-MUC-LHR. A340-600 from Cape Town - plane not crowded so good service again with satisfactory food and drinks. Attendants served beverages throughout the night. Seats were comfortable all round. Minimal fuss and no problems with delays - all flights on time. Very good long haul flight. Short hop from Munich to London was good as well with breakfast snack served just right for this length. IFE can have more up to date movies and music but small price to sacrifice.
1862,,Kovacs Charles,Hungary,6th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,Impossibly thin seat and insufficient legroom and this was a long flight (Philadelphia to Frankfurt). Very poor food even by economy standards. Inflight entertainment system did not work well choice of classical music weighted towards modern composers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew. Lufthansa used to be a good airline but these days it's more like a discounter charging legacy prices. Avoid it if you can.
1863,,Jarolim Petr,United States,6th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,9,Very happy with our first class flights. The first class lounge in Munich was very pleasant with the usual high quality food offerings. The food onboard was good when traveling from Boston to Munich on 10/17 and outstanding on the way back - Munich to Boston on 10/26. Service also very good Boston-Munich and absolutely outstanding on the Munich-Boston flight. The flight attendant on the Munich-Boston flight was fast efficient and very pleasant. Entertainment was OK we both care more for recent movies than the latest releases but I understand it's difficult to please everyone. I'd say that the Wi-Fi should be free in first class. The Munich-Prague and Prague-Munich segments in business class were pretty much standard the Munich-Prague flight was quite delayed fortunately for us the Prague-Munich flight was on time. All in all a pleasant experience.
1864,,Schaefer Michael,Germany,6th November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,yes,2,Flight LH491 - really bad seats. TV box under the seat. No room for legs (I'm 185cm tall) TV selection was poor. Touch screen hardly worked. Sound was awful and flickering monitor.
1865,,Oehmichen Alexander,Germany,3rd November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Travelling from Frankfurt to London-City. Fast boarding procedure and arriving on time. The sandwich on board was really tasty and a decent snack on this one hour flight. The friendly flight attendants completed this pleasant journey.
1866,,Kristine Schaefer,Germany,3rd November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,IAD (Washington Dulles) to MUC (Munich Germany) LH 415 Oct 5 2014. Seat comfort: The aircraft was an A330-300. I had a window seat. Foot space was ridiculously small as two metal boxes of about 10 cm width each were fixed to the legs of the seat in front of me. Every window seat seemed to have that feature. This makes a long haul flight very uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment: The touch screen took ages to react or was so sensitive or insensitive that I never knew whether I had pressed it correctly or not. The rest was fine.
1867,,K Roberts,United States,3rd November 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,no,2,Flight out of Krakow to Munich cancelled due to heavy fog. Lufthansa in Krakow put us up in hotel for night with vouchers for meals. Lufthansa staff at Krakow were great cannot say the same for the staff in Germany! Re-booked next day to Munich one hour layover then home to Chicago. Flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. Thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller. Announcements on plane about other connections but none regarding Chicago. I asked a flight attendant before we landed and she said she knew nothing. We arrived late in Munich So the 2 of us and 3 other passengers missed our connecting flight to Chicago by minutes! No one at gate in Munich to assist us. Finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be re-booked. Re-booked to Frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to Chicago the next day. When we boarded short flight to Frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting! In Munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in Frankfurt. Arriving in Frankfurt we had to go to Service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. He directed us to belt 16 Baggage claim B to get our luggage. We got there no luggage! Talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at A and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. She finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. Frankfurt airport is huge and Lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. Classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The clincher is when we boarded our flight to Chicago the next day we were delayed because a family was detained in immigration! What happened to not being able to hold the plane? Horrible service. Unless Lufthansa is the only airline flying to where I am traveling I am not using them again. No one seemed to know and much less care.
1868,,M Marchetti,Italy,31st October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,6,MUC-JFK flight LH410. Good on board service. Economy seats really to small for a continental 9 hours flight (central row one of the last in the rear of plane). If you want to choose your seat during booking or before check-in you will be charged an additional fee.
1869,,U Fritsch,Germany,31st October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,yes,6,Took flight LH 494 from Munich to Toronto on October 23 2014. Flight was 1 hour delayed departure as well as arrival. Plane was technically up-to-date. On-board personnel and service was satisfactory. All equipment worked without fail. Seats were reasonably comfortable and provided satisfactory space. Entertainment program provided wide range of choices. All-in-all good flight despite the delay.

1871,,Dimitrios Salampasis,Luxembourg,31st October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,I am a Lufthansa frequent customer and I have always enjoyed their service and timetable. My flight experience from YUL to MUC left me with a bit of mixed feelings. Even though the flight is not that long approx. 7 hrs the plane was fully packed with people and the seats were really uncomfortable. It was not possible to move around and not even sleep. Furthermore the passenger in front of me considered her right to keep her seat not in the fully upright position during the entire flight leaving me with very limited space. And when I asked the flight attendants to tell her to bring her seat a bit further up so as to have some space myself I was taken by surprise to hear that they could not wake her up and that I should simply do the same or change seat (I seat that I had pre-selected and paid). Maybe Lufthansa needs to reconsider the number of passengers and luggage allowed for long- haul flights and not treat passengers as commodities to that respect.
1872,,R Thut,Switzerland,31st October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,yes,7,"FRA-BRE-FRA last weekend. Outbound was really good. Cabin Crew very friendly. Always had a smile on their face. Service was very good. They served a cold breakfast which was very good. The way back to FRA was more or less OK. Was not that friendly. What annoyed me was that there were 3 flight attendants as ""Business Class Passengers"" seated. Not my thing at all that staff flies business class and chit chat all the way loudly. Sorry folks of LH but keep things a bit down especially when you have paying business class passengers on flights. Seat them either in the back close to the galley or on a jump seat when the flight is full. I recommend this airline because the way to BRE they did go the extra mile."
1873,,N Bojkova,United States,28th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,Flight LH495. I flew from Munich to Toronto. The flight was very relaxing with excellent service and food. I arrived to some extent relaxed despite of the long trip.
1874,,W Coulton,Australia,28th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4,yes,9,Short hop FRA-DUB on A321. Check in and cabin crew friendly. Decent snack served on this 2 hr flight. Departed on time and arrived early. The slimline seat provided extra legroom and was OK for this length flight but may be a bit hard if the sector is longer. Very happy to use again at least on European sectors.
1875,,A Bland,United Kingdom,22nd October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Manchester-Chisinau via Munich. Initial outward flight delayed due to crew 'being stuck in traffic' although all passengers were waiting at the gate on time (it was a full flight). Standard of slimline seating on Lufthansa flights not comfortable at all (way too hard even for relatively short flights). Cabin crew pleasant and drinks / snacks ok. On return journey Lufthansa had another delayed flight back to Manchester with plenty of seats still available that would have got me home much earlier than my booked flight but their 'customer service' staff in Munich wouldn't entertain allowing me on it that would be far too helpful for them. All in all nothing special for the price far too inflexible / not focussed on customers and I'll avoid Lufthansa in future for that reason.
1876,,T Noone,Germany,22nd October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,yes,5,I recently flew on Luthansa Flight LH414 (Munich to Washington D.C.). Plane was good but the service was marginal. Flight service was very rushed. One got the impression that they wanted to get everything done quickly so that they could sit in the back and talk which this is what they did. I sat in the last row of the plane.
1877,,Lekon Niels,Germany,22nd October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Flew with a A330 from Munich to NYC (JFK airport). It was a pleasant trip. Comfortable seats nice and very helpful flight attendants. Unlike e.g. British Airways which I have used for my last two trips to North America the catering on board was great. Additional water or juice e.g. was served regularly. The snack before landing consisted of Weißwurst Pralinen and a Laugenbrötchen which was very delicious. I asked for an extra portion which I got without any hesitation. They would have thrown away any leftover food anyway so I thought eating another portion would be better as it was extremely good. The only downside to the flight was that the aircraft engines are quite loud compared to other aircraft's. Also the choice of films could have been better. Overall I was very satisfied.
1878,,Matthias Ullrich,Germany,22nd October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,LH494 MUC-YYZ. Airbus A330-300 (333) V1 (re-vamped interior with the new LH biz class seats) seated in eco emergency row 30 window seat pair. Status customer with LH (senator) travelling with partner. Ground service (baggage drop-off lounge etc.) seamless as always. Sky service attentive quick quiet very professional little kids of other passengers and elderly passengers all taken care of with help. Sky catering as good as you can expect in eco little treats added to the overall good level. New version of LH safety script at taxiing is much improved easy-to-understand delivered at the right slow pace w/o becoming dragging and boring. Also no bothering bold music during take-off/landing times as with some other *A carriers. Overall LH manifests that they are of course not the cheapest but they quietly excel in numerous details by those few percent compared to others. You just feel that little bit less worn after an LH eco long-haul as you might do after one with other carriers.
1879,,Thomas Pornschlegel,Germany,22nd October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Excellent lounge at IAD with pre-flight meals. Direct boarding of the aircraft from there. Unobtrusive friendly service. Excellent sleeping comfort in the first class cabin.
1880,,T Mahr,Germany,20th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2,no,2,Just off LH2051 TXL-MUC. Probably ranks as one of the worst flights ever - no welcome onboard plane totally full however no help from crew in stowing luggage - busy chatting among themselves. Pilot eventually told us they would delay the flight if we did not manage to stow baggage ourselves. Rude and snotty service inflight with no smiles. Seats uncomfortable and too short. In addition to that all flight delayed as usual. LH is going downhill.
1881,,Uwe Günther,Switzerland,12th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,FRA-LAX and return. New business class is very comfortable and Lufthansa crew is always friendly. Food was also good generous portions and very varied. Only downside on LH is the entertainment system. They could add more recent movies to their list.
1882,,Andal Raghavan,United States,12th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,My wife flew on 10/6/2014 from Newark NJ on Flight LH 403 to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Chennai India on Lufthansa LH758. For health reasons my wife needs a wheelchair as she has trouble walking. We requested a wheelchair for her at the Newark Frankfurt and Chennai airports. Everything was fine in Newark NJ. However when she arrived at Frankfurt no wheelchair was provided. Lufthansa staff advised her there was no wheelchair and to walk slowly. When my wife told them she can hardly walk and carry the carry-on luggage they ignored her. Finally one Lufthansa staff walked her to the bus to the next flights terminal but she did not help in any way. Seeing my wife’s inability to move the carry-on another kind passenger helped her. When she arrived at her terminal she had to wait for the cart to drive her to her gate. Lufthansa staff needs to be trained in customer service especially service to individuals who need assistance. These flights are not inexpensive and there is no excuse for this type of rude and incompetent service.
1883,,John Comissiong,Germany,12th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,2,3 of 4 flight segments this year have all been delayed. The last one being this morning from BCN-FRA over 30 minutes late. On the outbound FRA-BCN economy passengers were served half of a sandwich. That's how far LH has sunk now.
1884,,Svensson Dan,Sweden,12th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Excellent service and customer focus on the flight LH474 to Montreal. Quick and fast check in and boarding. Flight departure was delayed due to technical problem with luggage room with 1 hour but was partly caught up during the trip. Good and continuous information about the repair status by the flight officers.
1885,,A Bergmann,Austria,12th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Flight LH 409 Newark to Dusseldorf in September. Flight was operated by an older A340-300 which was in very good condition and had nice inflight entertainment on big personal screens (much better than on Lufthansa's A330s at the moment). IFE featured loads of movies and fancy stuff such as real time speed / altitude. Flight departed about 1 hour late. Nevertheless I could easily catch my connection to Vienna. Food was alright could have been a little more though. Drinks were always available. Cabin crew did a great job very friendly and professional. Seat comfort was good for Economy Class enough legroom and I like the 2-4-2 seating. Changing in Dusseldorf was very convenient (small distances and a nice airport). I'm usually very satisfied with Lufthansa.
1886,,A Palomo,United Kingdom,12th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,BHX to Munich via Frankfurt and Munich to Birmingham inbound. Could not fault the flights I had with them. Service was very good and cabin crew attentive. Travelled with two friends for the Oktoberfest who were both 6ft 6in and I am below 6 ft. Both of my tall friends had no complaints with the legroom. Baggage arrived on time. All in all flights had been hassle-free. Only downside is lack of entertainment but for a short flight it was barely noticeable. Will definitely fly with them again.
1887,,J Braun,Austria,12th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,9,FRA-JFK 747-8 in First Class. Truly First Class experience all the way from the exclusive feel of the FCT at Frankfurt limo to the plane and then a very warm and professional welcome from the fantastic crew. Cabin 7/8 full. Seats 1A and 1K are great for people traveling together although not the most private. Beautifully elegant cabin comfortable seat/bed and simply wonderful service. Only the food was disappointing - nothing special and poorly presented. Excellent wines. Bags first off at JFK and off the plane and through Customs within 20 minutes! Would definitely fly again.
1888,,Stephan Wismann,Canada,8th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,3,no,4,Entertainment System and reading lamp didn't work and this is not the first time. I traveled 7 times this year between Canada and Germany with Lufthansa and 3 times the entertainment system at my seat was broken. Especially on such a long overseas flight it is unacceptable!
1889,,Olle Olerup,Sweden,8th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,4,Lufthansa flight LH763 from Delhi to Munich October 4th 2014. Out-dated and worn business class seats. Possible to recline fully but narrow. Really close to non-existent service. Despite few passengers in business class very slow and inattentive service. After initial take-off beverages no more drink service of water or anything else. Food quality like in a cheap charter flight. No one of the staff bothered to serve a quick breakfast to those passengers who wanted to sleep a bit longer not even a cup of coffee.
1890,,Edwin Eisenberg,United States,8th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flight 427 PHL to Frankfurt on August 23 2014. This flight was supposed to have new business class. The video was non-functional and my seat would not operate properly. We were in 4A and 4C. At the end of the flight the flight attendant found a large water bottle in the mechanism inside the seat cushion. Headphones were loose attached to the console and not in separated plastic bags. Drinks were horrible. The flight attendants were nice. The stewardess told us at the end of the flight that planes were switched in Frankfurt.Our flight from Frankfurt to Athens was on a 321 airbus. Business class was 3 thin coach seats with no one in the middle seat.
1891,,V Ladhani,Germany,5th October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,TXL-FRA-RIX: Both the legs were operated by A321. Crew were pleasant on both the flights especially that onwards to RIX. They were lively willing to help and didn't mind making small talk with passengers. Like all LH flights even this one was refitted with Recaro seats and ceiling attached TV. Passengers were served muesli bars on first leg and on the second leg yoghurt dip with freshly chopped fruits - this is what disappoints me as LH takes pride in being full service airline. Previously they at least served freshly baked bread rolls and sandwiches. LH should really reconsider on snacks they serve as I believe 120 mins are enough to serve a proper small meal although the crew is saving grace and made several drink rounds. I have travelled extensively on different airlines and wouldn't hesitate to suggest LH to up their game.
1892,,Lutz Reinhart,Romania,1st October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 465 9/21/2014. Lufthansa provided excellent value a very pleasant flight experience and great professional staff from pilots to cabin crew! It is always a pleasure to fly with Lufthansa because their crew really values you and gives you the best flight experience possible. The cabin crew were very responsive. The seats were comfortable. There is none of the nickel-and-diming miserliness other airlines seem to specialize in. The service is prompt courteous and generous!
1893,,Christian Streuber,Germany,1st October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,3,LH 464. The plane was changed between flight booking and the flight itself therefore all passengers (especially families) could not sit together as originally planned. Everything was mixed up. The way the flight attendants worked with this was not very helpful. Many children were on this flight. The flight back was much better. Nevertheless I would book Lufthansa again.
1894,,Eelco van den Heuvel,Netherlands,1st October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,DUS-LHR-DUS. One of the last LH-routes out of Dusseldorf because LH has transferred almost all European and domestic flights to Germanwings. That's a pity because once again LH showed why it's a great airline. Friendly staff -ground and air - and a very punctual performance on both legs. Tasty sandwich two drinks and reasonable comfort on the A320. A little more expensive than the LCC's but it's worth it. LH stays my favourite airline. And once again Dusseldorf airport is a breeze.
1895,,J Busse,Canada,1st October 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,AC 9433 - LH476 on Tuesday Sep 23rd 2014. Innovative food. Good service. Generous inflight entertainment. Seat is as uncomfortable as everybody else's in economy.
1896,,Fraser Ann,United Kingdom,28th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Our return flights MAN-Munich LH2503/2 Aug 26 and Sep 23. Consistently reliable friendly and courteous staff. Cabin in reasonable condition. Very happy to fly Lufthansa on this route. We also flew return MUC-YVR LH476/7 on the same dates. Outbound 26 August. Inbound 23 September. The business class seats were fine we were in rows 4 and 11. For me row 4 was far more private. Seats fine but not as good as Qatar's 777 flights. Comfortable reclining and flat for overnight. Slept reasonably well. I'd do this again at the right price. Food fine with reasonable variety. Staff efficient without being engaging whereas staff on the Manchester leg were more friendly and charming on both flights than the long haul crew. Overall happy with experience but do think the long haul staff should be more engaging.
1897,,Natalia Massingill,United States,28th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,no,3,LH436 from Krakow to Frankfurt flight delay 1 hour due to bad weather in Frankfurt end up missing connecting flight to Chicago by few minutes. Big confusion at the airport being sent from station to station 4 times before we finally got to ticket agent than we waited 4 hours to get new flight out of Germany for next morning! Frankfurt to Dusseldorf to Chicago and again delay of 40 minutes and almost missed Chicago flight again thank goodness the airport is small as we got on the plane at the last minute. Airbus is definitely more comfortable than the Boeing 747 - not enough leg room even for someone 5 ft 5 seats too narrow - misery for 9 hours. Staff very nice and pleasant.
1898,,J Stein,United States,24th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,no,7,"I flew from Frankfurt to Newark NJ on the last leg of a 4-leg trip to Turkey and flew in Business Class on a 747. My seat was dirty with crumbs in the glasses holder wasn't able to use my own headphones for in-flight entertainment and the movies system was slow unresponsive and had few movie choices. I watched a DVD that I brought rather than dealing with these issues. The food was ok but unimpressive although the croissants were fresh and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed the red wine and was constantly refilled as well as coffee when I switched and the seat was comfortable once I was able to manipulate my 6'1"" frame into a comfortable position. All in all the flight was fine but I wasn't as impressed as I should have been."
1899,,Fargel Matthias,Germany,22nd September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,"Brand new airbus A330 from Munich to Vancouver. New inflight entertainment with rich variety of movies and music. However the sound volume was far too low for enjoying the acoustics. Seats in Economy improved. Best of all however: very clean washrooms during the entire 10.5 hr flight. Flight attendants went in with gloves quite frequently. Food in economy class was ok I always pre-book Asian Vegetarian which seems to be a ""winner"": tasty and sufficient."
1900,,Fargel Matthias,Germany,22nd September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,"Brand new airbus A330 from Munich to Vancouver.

1901,,C Currie,United Kingdom,22nd September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,no,6,LH721 PEK-FRA Airbus A380. Advance online seat reservation was not working but able to get an aisle during online checkin - which opened earlier than the advertised 23 hours before the flight so most good seats were gone. Seats are very cramped - 31 inch pitch is too small for a long-limbed 6 footer like me. Entertainment system was awful - screen far too close painfully slow the films were old and music content limited audio barely audible. On the plus side staff were excellent.
1902,,D Bowtell,Australia,19th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,LH 426 FRA to Philadelphia Tues 16th 1pm but changed to LH432 to Chicago at 5.10pm 16th. American connecting flight number to Philadelphia (arriving 1.15am today). Flight from Frankfurt to Philadelphia cancelled and rebooked on a later flight arriving almost half a day later. These things happen but the systematic rudeness and lack of consideration of the staff made matters worse. I've often found Lufthansa staff are among the most lacking in consideration of any airline.
1903,,G Baldacchino,Canada,19th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,5,LH 475 Sept 14 2014 YUL to MUC. Great staff service that ensured my wife and I plus luggage were on this flight in spite of a non-through ticket and just 50 minutes of transit time. The flight itself was much less pleasant - cramped seats not enough foot room in front of seat and an entertainment system that leaves much to be desired.
1904,,Christoph Günther,Germany,19th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,3,I am traveling frequently with Lufthansa and am usually quite satisfied. On the positive side of LH415 I would like to mention that they managed to transfer my luggage although United co-chair LH9295 was extremely late. The seats on LH415 can however only be rated as less than adequate. LH does not yet offer any form of economy plus. The seat are both rather narrow (8 lines of seats in an A330!) and the spacing between them is completely insufficient for tall people. I will not fly this airplane in this configuration anymore. The provision of classical music is mostly absent.
1905,,Eva Hoefer,Germany,19th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Unfortunately check-in was rather unfriendly and extremely picky about baggage numbers sizes and weights. Neither professional nor customer-oriented service. The actual flight was pleasant only food quality was not as adequate as during flight from MUC to YVR (poor seasoning pasta overcooked). Unfortunately no non-alcoholic beer on-board.
1906,,C Hoffmann,Germany,19th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight form Munich to Malaga LH1834. Flight left on time and arrived 10 minutes early. Surprisingly good legroom for economy but there is no entertainment offered what so ever bring your iPad if you want to watch something. Flight attendants were friendly sandwiches were served we good.
1907,,Samson Fung,Germany,19th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,"LH 476 MUC-YVR 3 Sep 2014. Direct flight in a Airbus 330 which seems to be a small aircraft for such a long 10 hour flight. Food in Y class as bad as always on European airlines. Seats extremely narrow for such a long haul flight (OK for European or continental flights but for Intercontinental flights not enough space). Service as good as it can get in this class. Beverage OK but below standard compared for many airlines particularly in comparison to Asian or Gulf region carriers. Entertainment system really bad (old films that I can hardly remember from my youth). Seat distribution unclear and not well thought through (eg LH has an initiative for ""doctors on board"" and medics can subscribe to this program however flight attendants do not seem to be aware of this initiative in addition medics obviously are not listed thus unknown and do not get seats easy to be prepared for emergencies. Instead they are often seated in the middle of the rows thus hindering them to quickly react)."
1908,,Klaus Schubert,Germany,17th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Vancouver-Munich-Dusseldorf. LH477 YVR to MUC on 3/4.9.14. Good service by ground staff priority security Maple Leaf Lounge International by Air Canada (good Business Class Lounge). A330-300 with new First Class. Beautiful cabin clean and in good condition. Flight on time. Excellent service from a professional and very friendly crew in a nearly full cabin. Dinner (including caviar) and breakfast top class wide choice of good beverages. Good quiet and dark cabin for night flight. In Munich limousine service to the terminal and assistance to the LH-First Class lounge excellent lounge with a wide choice of high-class food and beverages and own passport control by German Federal Police. LH2016 MUC to DUS on 4.9.14 (Business) with A320. Flight on time. Friendly staff small high quality menu. All in all an outstanding satisfactory experience.
1909,,B Wintersperger,Canada,17th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,LH 494 MUC-YYZ Sept 1 2014. Nice exit row seating with availability to Senators unfortunately the exit row reservation has now also become available for an extra charge limiting the benefit of the Senator status. Smooth flight and inflight entertainment with no issues.
1910,,G Schaer,Switzerland,14th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,2,yes,6,YUL-MUC LH475. Flight and information: good seats are tight. Entertainment system: Screen was bad as the image jumped (trough all programs) good choice of programs/movies. Service: good. Food: chicken was awful lentils fine breakfast average.
1911,,T Wynne-Jones,United Kingdom,14th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"There are very few flights between London and Hanover so thinking Lufthansa was an organized airline my firm booked me a flight via Frankfurt. It's a mediocre flight from London to Frankfurt however the flight parked at the gate they did not use the finger instead passengers were all expected to get out at the rear of the aircraft and take a bus ride to another part of the airport (this seems to happen a lot with Lufthansa flights from London to Berlin and Dusseldorf too). After an involuntary tour of the airport I battled my way through security customs and immigration to get to the Hanover gate only to find the plane had gone. To my way of thinking this represents ""mis-selling"" as there is no way anyone is ever going to make the advertised connection in 30 minutes (not at Frankfurt anyway). Perhaps Lufthansa regard English passengers as ""under-people"". To add salt to my wounds Lufthansa made no apologies and just bumped me onto the next flight four hours later. I complained again at Frankfurt customer service which was a log wait amongst the flotsam and jetsam but was only offered a €10 coffee voucher which I declined as an insult. I can only assume that Lufthansa is now competing with German Wings for the most miserable service. Try and leave a comment on Lufthansa's web page and they actually believe people still use fax machines."
1912,,Gallo Francesco,Italy,14th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,I flew from Toronto to Munich (LH495) in Economy class on an Airbus A330-300. Clean sufficiently comfortable. No power access. Good dinner bad breakfast. Absolutely on time.
1913,,Juraj Kovac,Czech Republic,6th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,PRG-FRA-SIN-FRA-HAM both trips with late evening departures. Compared to other airlines on the route Lufthansa is downright boring but absolutely efficient. The short-haul A320s have zero IFE and only a bare minimum in terms of onboard comfort but the handling and service is flawless. My 19.30 flight from PRG was delayed which would have prevented me from making a tight connection in FRA. Instead baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight which was delayed as well and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380 which is always a treat. The cabin is extremely basic and the AVoD is just average but the service is snappy and organized meals are good crews are friendly. It's hard to get a good night's sleep in economy but the overall experience is still as painless as it gets.
1914,,Sara Kreil,Canada,6th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,8,I flew with Lufthansa from Montreal to Berlin overnight on Friday. I had a very nice flight. The seats were comfortable the food was tasty the service was friendly and overall I was quite pleased. My only complaint was that the plane was very cold. Also the flight was quite expensive. However I am usually willing to pay a bit more for a Lufthansa flight. The inflight entertainment system was having some trouble as well. It was very very slow.
1915,,Borowy Irene,Canada,6th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Last Sunday Aug 25 2014 I was flying from Warsaw to Frankfurt when the Lufthansa plane leaving for Frankfurt was delayed due to some unexpected circumstances. As a result I missed my connecting Air Canada flight from Frankfurt for Calgary. When I went to Lufthansa desk at the Frankfurt airport the ladies there were more than accommodating trying to offer me as many options as possible to get me to my destination. I opted for the next day flight to Calgary via Vancouver. The stay at the Interhotel at the Lufthansa expense was very pleasant great food and room made me forget about a snag in my return trip. But the biggest surprise was still awaiting me at the boarding time when I learned that my ticket was upgraded to Business Class. Excellent service.
1916,,Uwe Langhammer,United States,6th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,9,Flew IAH-FRA-TXL and back FRA-IAH and First Class Service did live up to the title. The NEK in Europe might need some extra legroom instead of the empty middle seat. Friendly Crew great culinary experience and just a good way to go over the Atlantic. A380 is good way to travel.
1917,,J Donahue,Germany,6th September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew LH 454 21 Aug 14 FRA-SFO A380 and LH797 31 Aug 14 HKG-FRA B748. Great service provided in the air as well as on the ground. Food choices were good and fresh. Unfortunately the A380 still had the old angle-flat seat. The B748 had the new flat beds.
1918,,A Casamax,Italy,1st September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,LH411 from JFK to Munich 23 August 2014. I sat in Business class together with my family. The comfort was satisfactory for the space the seats and the service. Staff was very friendly and professional food and drinks were of good quality. Overall I appreciated the service and quality of this airline. I am frequent traveler and I always prefer to travel with Lufthansa both in economy and business so I recommend it to everyone.
1919,,Holme Stefan,Germany,1st September 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,First Class Service in First Class Cabin. Well there might not be much justification to buy a first class intercontinental flight ticket since a business class flight will be a fraction of cost which may give your controller a hardtack. But if you just have to stay for a meeting in the US and return within 48hrs to your desk in Europe you might consider for your personal sake to spend more money just to arrive back home relaxed. Lufthansa new First Class offers an outstanding service to arrive rested ready to make decisions. Compared to some of the Gulf Region Airlines the Lufthansa first might be considered plain and functional but the service is professional and surpassing.
1920,,Tercon Bojan,Singapore,28th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew the brand new 747-800 on this Washington D.C. to Frankfurt route. Was my first time and was very curious about it. The upper deck business class is very quiet and has a private feel to it. I also like that you have a private storage compartment right below the window like on the upper deck of an A380. Lufthansa has made some innovative design choices. For example in the bathrooms the toilet seat and cover both have a separate handle so that it's easy to lift either up. Such a simple invention yet I've never seen it on other airlines. The new biz class seat is a huge improvement over the old angled-flat seat which is still used on all their other planes. It's a friendly configuration for if you're traveling with a friend the seats are slightly angled towards each other making it easy to converse. In sleep mode the seat is unfortunately not too comfortable especially since the footrest where your feet go is very narrow. The food and service was ok. They had a good selection of wines and the menu had a regional focus focusing on cuisine from the area you're flying from. Love the idea however taste wise it was not outstanding. Overall though a huge improvement from their old business class. I hope they upgrade the rest of their long-haul fleet with these seats.
1921,,Ivan Dzhur,United States,28th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,I took six flight operated by LH this month. Two of these were long haul - EWR-DUS on August 3rd and MUC-EWR on August 26th the other four were intra european - DUS-VIE on August 4th LWO-MUC-DUS on August 16th and LWO-MUC on August 26th. All of the above flights were on time pro active and kind cabin staff and ground staff. Meals and drink service were great cabin crew always ready to offer refreshments and drinks on long haul flights. Hot towels served on long haul flight were much appreciated. Seat comfortable on all flights except one from MUC to EWR where LH Airbus 340-600 still had old economy class seats. Will certainly recommend Lufthansa!
1922,,A Wandschneider,Germany,28th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,July 13th 2014 LH2067 HAM-MUC. LH0476 MUC-YVR. Aug 2nd 2014 LH0493 YVR-FRA. LH0016 FRA-HAM. Our flights were on time and regarding the soccer-final Germany-Argentina we received a special service - free wifi and cold- fresh beer. That was excellent. Lufthansa does not provide perfect space and service however as an economy-flyer I trust in the quality of the planes and I'm always satisfied with LH.
1923,,A Thomas,Sweden,28th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,2,Although I managed to check-in online with Lufthansa via Avianca given an earlier connecting La Paz to Bogota flight the latter did not let me print boarding passes told to report to the check-in counter. Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system only in La Paz by Lufthansa despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation. The seat was finally changed grudgingly - without apology or even a smile - at the gate to 55G at a part of plane and side I did not like at all.
1924,,Tercon Bojan,Singapore,28th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,On this very short 40 min flight from Frankfurt to Brussels Lufthansa managed to serve a full and very yummy breakfast. Efficient and impressive service on this 737-500 plane. The American airlines could learn something from Lufthansa about service and meals on short regional flights.
1925,,Kuestenbrueck Armin,Germany,26th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,11/8/2014 LH475 YUL-MUC. After online check-in (even without printed boarding pass / mobile phone) baggage drop- off at Montreal airport (YUL) was done within 5 mins. Landed on time. Friendly service. Quiet flight.
1926,,F Kellh,Germany,26th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight Lufthansa 414 Munich - Washington. Another positive experience with Lufthansa. Service reliability quality was very high. Flight was on time (arrived earlier then planned). Personnel were friendly food good etc.
1927,,A Fischer,Germany,26th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,The most comfortable seats now in the new A330-300 in business as well as in economy the entertainment system actually works (though your own headset might be a bit better than the Lufthansa one in coach) and delicious food in business plus the usual chicken or pasta (sorry pasta is out) in coach. Don't worry the chicken is fine. What do you want more for your money? I did continue on Air Canada with expensive poor food in domestic headset you pay for but which do not work is that really necessary to save cost? I would rather fly on Lufthansa.
1928,,Syska Matthias,Germany,26th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,3,LH411 from JFK to Munich 18th August 2014. I sat in Economy class together with my kids. The comfort was more or less unsatisfactory because of the space between the rows the passengers around us and the service. Staff were not very friendly and motivating all additional drinks had to be requested by ourselves and their presence in the cabin was very low. Seemed that they were more interested in talking than working. I am frequent traveler and spend thousands of Euros on LH tickets every year and have experienced the following: the prices have increased and the service and quality decreased. I do not feel or see any value for money.
1929,,Tagariello Carl,United States,26th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Aug 1 2014 JFK to Vienna flight OS88 operated by Austrian Air (through Lufthansa). Return Aug 14 2014 Prague to Frankfurt flight LH1397. Frankfurt to JFK flight LH404. My first and last trip with Lufthansa! I booked in Feb 2014 for a trip in Aug. My wife and I are senior citizens and booked bulkhead seating (knee problems). When we arrived at the airport we were informed that our reserved seats were given away. We were given no explanation and promptly given two middle seats in different aisles. When I protested I was told there was nothing that could be done. Later we were given middle seats next to each other. The TV screens did not work properly-a perfect ending to a terrible flight.
1930,,F Kellh,Germany,26th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight Lufthansa 414 Munich - Washington. Another positive experience with Lufthansa. Service reliability quality was very high. Flight was on time (arrived earlier then planned). Personnel were friendly food good etc.
1931,,A Fischer,Germany,26th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,The most comfortable seats now in the new A330-300 in business as well as in economy the entertainment system actually works (though your own headset might be a bit better than the Lufthansa one in coach) and delicious food in business plus the usual chicken or pasta (sorry pasta is out) in coach.

1932,,Emmanuel Karavelas,Greece,20th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,5,yes,7,"PEK-MUC July 22 Flight LH723. Aircraft Airbus A340-600. Although I had checked Lufthansa site and was informed that my flight would have the ""new Business Class service"" it turned out that the small prints rule: this aircraft had the old and outdated Business class seats which from my point of view cannot provide the comfort Lufthansa's competition offer as none of its positions (seating leaning fully extended) could offer satisfactory comfort. Cabin crew very efficient polite discreet and professional. Food wine and beverages more than average. IFE limited. Lavatories very clean throughout the flight. Cockpit and cabin crew announcements informative. Amenities of high quality."
1933,,A Orzechowski,United States,18th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Another great flight MUC-YYZ on the Airbus A330-300. Meals the best I've tasted on a transatlantic flight with real cutlery!
1934,,Tautz Hanno,Germany,18th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,no,5,LH 414 7 Aug 2014 MUC-IAD. I have 3 complaints about the flight with my wife last Thursday: 1) With the online check-in I could not get a boarding pass. There was a message that a failure occurred but not which kind of failure and how to correct it. 2) There were two check-in lines at the airport. After 30 mins queuing Lufthansa personnel asked me for the boarding pass before I could continue in the line. As I could not get a boarding pass online or with the machine I could not go to the check-in counter. I had to queue in a second line. 3) At the other counter the seat reservation which we made 3 weeks before was cancelled. All this is very disappointing.
1935,,Schnitzer Bernd,Germany,18th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,We flew from Munich to Vancouver with LH 476. The airplane was in good shape and there were no delays. I flew with my wife who has Senator status with Lufthansa and I could experience how warmly she was welcomed by the crew. Unfortunately this led them to neglecting me to an extend that I had to be after them to get something else to drink that what my wife had asked for. Somehow many of the Lufthansa crews on long distance flights still miss the opportunities to show some kind of friendliness and one still has the feeling that one is sitting in a bus from A to B. The special meal (Asian vegetarian) was tasty and the wine selections was good.
1936,,Michael Baker,United States,18th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,We chose to connect with LH 482 A380 in Frankfurt to get from Paris to Miami even though we could have gone non stop on Air France/Delta. A great and wise choice especially for business class seating. Entire top deck of the A380 is premium seating only 6 across in business all seats recline 180 and face forward. First class service in every regard!
1937,,Lange Michael,Germany,15th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,MUC-VIE: LH (LH Cityline) A new CRJ 900 for this short flight absolutely okay. We got a snack free choice of drinks and the staff were friendly.
1938,,Robert Marshall,United Kingdom,15th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,Flew London Heathrow (LHR) to Larnaca (LCA) via Munich (MUC) on 22/07/2014 in economy. Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person. Happy to recommend Lufthansa though their check-in arrangements at LHR need serious review. The staff service rating applies to aircraft staff. Their LHR ground handling agent's staff would score a zero.
1939,,Sami Osman,Luxembourg,14th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,DXB-FRA. My economy experience was great! I was very surprised with the flight and service. The food was not excellent but neither was it poor - it was just right. I got my food on time and staff were very helpful seats were very comfortable. However the inflight entertainment was a little out of date and did not have many choices. Overall though I would definitely recommend Lufthansa.
1940,,Sami Osman,Luxembourg,14th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,DXB-FRA. My economy experience was great! I was very surprised with the flight and service. The food was not excellent but neither was it poor - it was just right. I got my food on time and staff were very helpful seats were very comfortable. However the inflight entertainment was a little out of date and did not have many choices.

1941,,Belloli Lorenzo,Italy,14th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight LH730 from Munich to Hong Kong. Seat G12. It was a very good experience staff on board really careful and friendly. The plane was quite new and seating perfect 180° recliner. Nice food for dinner could be improved for breakfast.
1942,,Bernd Sonderhuesken-Puchtinger,Germany,11th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,5,Staff on Lufthansa are normally very friendly and professional. Nothing to criticize. The seats in economy are a bit narrow - especially if the guest in front of you reclines the seat. The new onboard entertainment system on flight 477 from Vancouver to Munich is nice - as you have your own high quality touch screen with a standard 3.5 in plug for earphones. So your own (noise cancelling) headphones will work. You also get a USB charger on that. In my case the entertainment system did not contain any movies (probably introduced during service before the flight) and i was not able to watch any for the 11 hr flight.
1943,,C Whitten,United States,11th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flew from Munich to Toronto August 7th (over 8 hours) and the audio on our seats (3 middle seats in the very last row of the plane) did not work the entire flight. The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice. It was an extremely uncomfortable and frustrating flight. We had paid the same amount as all the other folks who had working electronics.
1944,,T Anderson,Germany,11th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,I was very disappointed with my flight itinerary. When I called Lufthansa to book my outbound flight to Munich Germany I inquired that 25 minutes to arrive at the gate to my connecting flight out of O'Hare Airport was impossible but she assured me I should not have any issues. Well I did my flight was late and I had to run though a crowded airport to get a shuttle bus to the connecting flight gate (United Airlines flight UA 6115 and UA952 on July 4 2014). My flight arrived at 5.25 and my connecting flight starting boarding at 5.20. My inbound (return flight home) was the worst Lufthansa flight I had been on. The plane was a smaller plane only 1 lavatory to serve the economy area on the plane and the food was horrible. I am considering never flying Lufthansa again.
1945,,Valli Viviana,Germany,6th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH476 on 27th July. Great flight very comfortable. Personnel very kind. I was upgraded to Business class and it was a great experience. I'm in Seattle for Business and I will fly back to Munich on Friday.
1946,,K Sutch,United States,6th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Excellent Service on the flight from Munich to Toronto. I was upgraded to Business and it was a real treat. All in all the flight was very good. Lots of legroom flat bed to rest wonderful service and good food. If I could change anything: better trays (for food) - this is the only element that I don't think is very comfortable but this isn't a reason to score lower. The LH team was excellent as usual on the flight(s) and it was a wonderful end to being in Europe by having gotten the upgrade into business.
1947,,Schulz Stefan,Germany,6th August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 476 30th July 2014. Fantastic flight with bonus points from miles and more in first for the entire family to Vancouver. Very friendly service both on the ground (the lounge in Munich was superb) and during the flight. The crew were very helpful and friendly. Everything was perfect except for the luggage delivery in Vancouver which despite our priority tags came last.
1948,,M Kramer,Germany,3rd August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,LH 457 24th July. The food is great you'd always want another plate even in Economy. The service and the crews are always friendly and willing to fulfil every need. They did come through the cabin every 20 minutes offering a selection of drinks from a tablet to not disturb the passengers sleeping. Onboard even in Economy nearly every drink is included and so you'll never regret choosing Lufthansa! The only drawback is the inflight entertainment system installed on the A380's and 747-8's the new RAVE system they refit onto the A330/A340 fleet is great but sadly it isn't available upon delivery of the aircraft as manufacturers don't install this system. But though the selection of movies in different languages is great the only bad thing about the system on A380 and 747-8 is the screens are responding extremely slow and they are quite small due to a lot plastic surroundings. And the flight information is insufficient as the system doesn't show altitude speed (ground and air) flight heading wind speed and direction and such stuff. Overall great flights with just this minor drawback.
1949,,Gnanadesikan Ram,United States,3rd August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew from Frankfurt to Washington on July 28 2014. The cabin crew were great and the service was fantastic. I ordered a vegetarian special meal and it was delicious. I was at one of the exit row seats and it was very cold. I talked to the crew about it and they took care of it immediately. I have been flying Lufthansa for the last 21 years and their service has been excellent. I never fly any other airline.
1950,,W Campbell,United States,3rd August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,Flew Business Class round-trip LAX -Stockholm Stockholm-SFO. I flew the 747-800 and was really impressed with the new Business. I sat downstairs and had a seat in the middle section where every seat is an aisle. Spacious and comfortable. All flight attendants are gracious - would not say so much that the food was any better than UAL. In fact their little mousse dessert was nothing compared to UAL's Ice Cream sundaes. On Lufthansa they gave us a small tin for the amenity kit. The toilets are well stocked with amenities. Inflight entertainment on the new 747-800 was exceptional. So many choices. The return flight from Munich was delayed due to a broken aircraft. We left about 2.5 hours late from MUC. They offered everyone food vouchers and handled the delay very well. While the old Business Class seating on this A340-600 is not at all as nice as the New BC - it was ok. The crew were exceptionally friendly and very careful to make sure that everyone was taken care of.
1951,,C Yiyi,Hong Kong,3rd August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,5,Frankfurt-Greece Zurich to Munich Munich-Toulouse Toulouse-Frankfurt on different days all within 8 days in July. Very pleased with the service and smiles. Friendly staff. All are short-haul so no entertainment. There were one or two flights with proper meals but the others only had snacks and drink. The food was all right as they are very short. The seats were hard but has okay comfort level. Some times check-in get a little confusing for the crew but that's my own problem as I transferred a lot. Pretty satisfied overall!
1952,,T Eldem,Canada,3rd August 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,BOS-MUC on A340-600. Smooth check-in with an exceptionally polite and efficient agent. The cabin was spotless with soothing colours and perfect temperature. The FA's were very attentive and maintained the professionalism and efficient service I am accustomed to from LH. The seats were the old angled business class seats which were comfortable in all positions except for sleeping as one tends to slide off the seat. The in-seat USB power did not work on any of the four seats my travel companions and I were seated in. The AVOD selection was limited and inferior to other transatlantic airlines. The meal service was prompt and the food was tasty. There was a wide range of beverage options with a good wine selection. Flight left and arrived on time. Lufthansa offers a good product with dependable service surprises are rare if any.
1953,,E Matthews,Germany,31st July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,4,The flight I took 3 days ago (Vancouver-Munich) was one of the most unpleasant flights I have taken of late. I am a vegetarian but eat dairy and yet again I was served the most disgusting food and snacks sorely lacking in flavour and variety. It is always the same and having taken 4 long haul flights with Lufthansa in the last month the meals are predictable and a major let down every time. I take my own food on board depending on allowances at airports but the vegetarian option (lacto-ovo) is lacking dairy and it is very frustrating to see others getting food that makes me even more hungry. Further the seats are very uncomfortable compared to other airlines with leg room appearing to shrink. Flying with other airlines I never suffer back ache but do on Lufthansa flights. I have seen standards drop over the years and find partner/star alliance partners are usually better. The staff were very brisk and unfriendly on the latest flight snatching ear phones from my hands 30 minutes before landing and knocking my friends arms passing in the aisles with carts constantly. The onboard entertainment again is limited compared to other airlines with less choice in both films TV and languages.
1954,,S Sheppard,Germany,31st July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,5,no,5,"LH410 on Sunday 20/07. Munich to JFK. The cabin crew are efficient but not especially friendly. Food is awful and always the same: Chicken or pasta (it's a well known joke between people traveling often to and from this destination). Not a fan of the new seats less comfortable than the old ones especially if you are more than 6""2 like me."
1955,,Arlotti Giovanni,Italy,29th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,yes,5,LH 104 Frankfurt - Munich 23 June 2014. LH 103 Munich - Frankfurt 21 July 2014. During both flights because of the short time at disposal and in spite of crew efforts beverages were only served to some people. I suggest they only serve cold pre-packed drinks and make sure they serve everybody.
1956,,Yiyi Chen,Hong Kong,29th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,6,Frankfurt to Greece then Zurich to Munich Munich to Toulouse Toulouse to Frankfurt. Very friendly staff always smiling no IFE as they are all very short flights. Seats are hard and thin but still comfortable. Not all flights had meals but the food and drinks were alright. But now Lufthansa is famous to me for losing my luggage as I lost them twice with only 4 flights should have better luggage services.
1957,,P Ries,United States,29th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2,no,1,FRA-BCN A321 on July 24 LH1130. Flight out of FRA was delayed. The seats are like camping folding chairs. Very uncomfortable! Fortunately only a short haul flight. One out of three bathrooms not fully operational on a fully booked flight. The purser confirmed that she was aware of the bathroom situation and that she had already two prior flights on the same aircraft that day. During beverage service same purser opened a bottle of sparkling wine mid cabin and showered three rows of guests plus the interior. There was sparkling wine dripping off the ceiling and the overhead bins for the next 15 min. Highly unprofessional! All in all not acceptable.
1958,,Hoehler Gerhard,Greece,29th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I travelled FRA-DEN on LH 457. The trip started with a two hour stay at Lufthansa's First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. Not only is the environment unique. There are dedicated security check and passport control facilities at this terminal which make travelling much more pleasant. Passengers are transferred by Limo from the First Class Terminal to the plane. The First Class arrangement on the upper deck of the Boeing 744 with a seat and a permanent bed for each passenger is unique and gives you a lot of personal space and privacy. The food was excellent and very well presented. Service by the cabin crew was attentive but not intrusive.
1959,,S Hoffmann,Germany,29th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 3618 and LH 712 FRA-ICN. I went from Cologne Central Station to Frankfurt Airport Station by AIRail and flew from Frankfurt Airport to Seoul Incheon. The train ride was fast and convenient as well as the check-in at the train station at Frankfurt Airport. No queuing necessary so the transfer time of around 2 hours was almost too long since security checks were not crowded. The flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes early. The service was excellent the cabin very modern (new 747-8) and the inflight entertainment offered a lot of variety of current movies and TV shows. Another benefit is that the train ride from Cologne to Frankfurt is rewarded with Miles too. All in all it was an excellent flight experience and I definitely recommend flying Lufthansa.
1960,,M Gruenig,Germany,27th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,6,LH 418 6 July 2014. Overall pleasant flight on the 747-8. Anybody with any financial means should avoid economy. The problem is not with the airline but the travel companions. The only real drawback are the seats which are too narrow in economy to sit in without severe back pain. I avoided the bathrooms. Luckily the flight was only 8.5 hours. What surprised me a bit was the shape of some of the interior knowing that the 747-8 is only around for a short while (carpeting wall sidings). As usual the staff is really top notch and worlds apart from US carriers and - sad to say - AF / KLM or BA. This is a different flying experience though not Singapore quite yet either.
1961,,E Simeone,Belgium,27th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,BRU-JFK via FRA 1st class - lounge in FRA is just perfect - Limo from and to plane also great service on board all is excellent service. B747-800 configuration is top notch except perhaps rest rooms because people from C class cabin tend to use this rest room. Apart from that baggage delivered on time. Will recommend.
1962,,Uwe Langhammer,United States,25th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,Our European travel was MUC-ZAD July 12 and ZAD-MUC-FRA July 20. We got upgraded on first leg and overall all 3 flights were on time and with friendly crews. Planes looked clean and new Eco Class seats were OK for the short flights. Happy Lufthansa has improved in terms of service and friendliness.
1963,,Chris Zerial,Australia,25th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,Flew 4 flights in total with Lufthansa whilst in Europe. Found the planes to be new and pleasant. The service from the check in staff and cabin crew however was nothing short of rude. Very blunt and did not pay any attention to staff during the flight (most were in conversation even during meal service). I asked the FA on one flight to store a small piece of art for me to which she said there was no room. Not impressed with their punctuality around boarding and departure.
1964,,R Pattison,United Kingdom,25th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,5,LH1785 Ankara to Munich and then onto Manchester. Not great the airline gave away my pre-booked seat with extra room. Not good considering I paid extra for it. Fortunately the check-in staff managed to sort me out a replacement. The airbus was not too bad the crew were very helpful. The inflight meal was absolutely dreadful. Neither I nor the crew could determine what form of protein it was. The horrible food and the airline giving my seat away soured what would have been a reasonable flight. I fly on business a great deal but not with Lufthansa again if I can help it.
1965,,P Mikolajski,Poland,25th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I flew Lufthansa last week. Flight number LH451 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. Plane was clean staff very friendly seats reasonable comfortable (in economy class) food and beverages were good. I would recommend Lufthansa to anybody else. Plane arrived on time to the final destination and safe.
1966,,J Egan,New Zealand,25th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,"FRA-HKG. Departed from the ""Z"" section of the terminal which is a hike. Boarding handled efficiently though getting everyone to take their seats proved to be a challenge. This is one of the newer 747s and the Y class seats are very good: aside from a decent recline the front of the seat lifts a bit as you lean back taking pressure off your lower back. Meal and service were good and flight arrived early in HKG."
1967,,F Juergens,Germany,25th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,Last month I flew FRA-Malta-FRA. With the exception of one seemingly bored and unfriendly flight attendant both crews were highly professional obviously well trained attentive and friendly. Both flights on time the cabins spotless. Good Service as usual especially regarding drinks. The only problem are the snacks they offered. On the first sector a plastic cup of fresh fruit salad and yoghurt tasty but not at all filling. Much worse on the flight back: a slice of disgusting lukewarm pizza of low quality in a bland cardboard box without logo a really bad presentation. Such a pity that this reliable airline one of the very best in my opinion is failing again and again with the snacks and food which is offered. Very good ticket rate booked early in advance.
1968,,J Hagen,Norway,17th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,yes,7,LH 1793. Overall a nice flight on time and efficient boarding and leaving the plane. Might be a surly morning but one of the attendants had an unnecessarily rude attitude. Just because I was slow to stand up (and crouch under the low ceiling) to leave the plane he asked me if I was ever going to leave and that other passengers wanted to get out as well. Never has this been a problem on any other airline. He also gave surly remarks to other passengers who didn't perform well enough. Sorry if this is a charm and humour I didn't pick up on though.
1969,,Lanz Ulrich,Austria,17th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,LH415 11 July 2014 Washington Dulles to Munich. I was lucky getting a seat with more space for the legs (front row). As usual I was very pleased to fly with Lufthansa. Unlike other times the seat comfort was not so nice I was not able to sleep. Could be either a matter of coincidence or the version of the seats on that plane. Looking nice and being brand new but pretty hard and not a good shape for my body.
1970,,D Watkins,Australia,15th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,Flight from Perth to Frankfurt via Singapore. Pleasantly surprised that the Lufthansa A380 flight was more pleasant (happy crew) and comfortable than the code-share Singapore airline flight Perth to Singapore. However the return flight from Toulouse to Perth turned into a nightmare due to thunderstorm causing delays into Frankfurt. The almost total lack of customer care while stranded over night at Frankfurt and a 7 hour wait to re- book (almost 5 hours of which was in a line on foot) was a disgrace. It is the fear of this recurring which means I will be highly unlikely to fly with Lufthansa again.
1971,,Yalcinkaya Yasemin,Italy,15th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,I prefer Lufthansa whenever possible. But on this flight LH 494 from Munich to Toronto we had the 4 middle seats on row 40 and there was no arm room. The room for the legs is also quite scarce. Other than the uncomfortable seating everything else was OK. My son had stomach issues and the flight attendants were very helpful.
1972,,Venu Raj,Austria,15th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Vancouver to Munich LH 477 4 July 2014. I found the Food to be sub-standard for a European airline and they also only serve German Wines. The seats are so cramped in Economy Class that it is hard to stretch yourself. They give you warm napkins only on the onward flight and not on return flights. I was carrying my suits so I asked the flight attendant if he could hang my suit in the wardrobe for me and his body language was so obvious that he did not want to oblige my request! Only when I argued with him did he agree to hang my suits. Flight attendants are generally unfriendly they hardly smile and it seems that they are doing the passengers a favor! They generally make a big thing even when your baggage is overweight by 2 or 3 kgs they only allow 23 kgs per passenger in Economy. Compare this to Emirates where you get a generous Baggage allowance of 30 kgs per person on Economy. When I checked at Vancouver Airport for my return flight my baggage was only overweight by 4 kgs but one of the airline staff members was very kind and allowed me to check my Bag in. If not for her I would have had to certainly pay an excess baggage fare!
1973,,A Wong,Canada,13th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,"June 10 2014 LH 493 to Frankfurt. July 3 2014 LH 476 to Vancouver. We paid extra for exit row seats and were not disappointed lots of legroom. Only critique was that people tend to congregate around area for bathrooms which isn't a big deal but when they hang out there for more than half an hour and keep bumping into you while you're trying to sleep then it's annoying. Outgoing flight was 747 and seemed to attract more ""standers"" return flight was 330 and shape of cabin did not encourage people to hang around as much. Pleasantly surprised at number of meals and snacks during both flights lots of variety service was great and flight attendants went out of way to accommodate other passengers with young children. Look forward to flying Lufthansa again hopefully in Premium or Business Class next time."
1974,,Johansson Robert,Sweden,13th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,LH 457 3rd July. Overall very good. The available leg space was however below all criticism. For some reason the A-C seats on row 44 on the 747-800 had about 1 decimeter less leg space than the other seats on the same row (and the rest of the plane). I have never been so cramped on an Intercontinental flight before (or any flight for that matter).
1975,,Kai Olesch,Germany,6th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,,4,yes,9,MUC-CGN return (twice). I am always happy when I can book Lufthansa (work related) because it is such a reliable and punctual airline. The check-in and boarding is very easy the planes are always clean a little snack and two drinks are provided and I can choose my favourite newspaper. Usually the crew greets with a smile and has a service-orientated attitude. The seats are a bit hard but for one-hour domestic flights this is no problem.
1976,,J Gonzalez,Germany,6th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,"27 June 2014 flight LH454. I flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to San Francisco on an A380 and it is not an experience I would like to repeat. I know flying economy is supposed to be uncomfortable and unpleasant on any airline but adding hundreds of passengers to what most other airplanes carry only compounds the misery. Space tight seats very narrow and food bland as usual for economy. What made this flight ""memorable"" were the long boarding lines and the length of time it took to get off the airplane after an 11 hour flight. I hope the A340 and the A330 airplanes stick around for a long time to come."
1977,,Heinz Julia,Germany,6th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,My flight to Washington with Lufthansa in Economy Class was a very convenient one. As I am a chronic patient I liked that I had enough space to move my feet water was offered often enough. The meals were fine and entertainment was abundantly offered.
1978,,Gustafsson Magnus,Sweden,6th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,I travelled with LH1402 from Frankfurt (Germany) to Prague (Czech Republic) on June 23 scheduled 21.55-22.55. Due to late change of aircraft from the planned Airbus A321 to an Airbus A320 Winglets the flight was slightly delayed but the flight managed to depart before the awful night ban at Frankfurt Airport. The aircraft was only one week old according to the crew. That was obvious everything was extremely tidy and clean. However no IFE and still the same type of Recaro seats with any support for your head which I find very uncomfortable below industry standards. I was seated in Business Class on seat 4F and the service were excellent. Even on this very short flight a very tasteful salad was served and before the meal drinks were served. Right the way it should be drinks before the meal. An excellent flight and a very good experience and the cabin staff even addressed you by your name when serving excellent.
1979,,Gustafsson Magnus,Sweden,6th July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,I travelled with Lufthansa from Stockholm Arlanda Sweden to Frankfurt Germany on June 23. The aircraft on this service was an Airbus A321. I travelled in Business Class and was seated on 4A. The overall experience is very good and everything is well thought through with German precision. The cabin was very clean and tidy and the service was very good. The food served on this route was a cold dish but very tasteful. If to complain about something the service was not especially well co-ordinated. The meal was served first and it took approximately 10 minutes before any drinks were served. I would have expected the opposite in Business Class. Lufthansa does not offer any IFE on intra-European flights but offers very good inflight magazines. The main negative thing to my opinion is the very uncomfortable seats. Recaro slim fit with very limited comfort. There is no head rest available so bring your cushion or maybe two and the seats are very hard. The seat pitch is however according to industry standards. On this occasion I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt with 1 hour transfer time. The flight was approximately 25 minutes late into Frankfurt but there were no problems with my transfer.
1980,,D Collard,Canada,3rd July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Vancouver-Munich-Geneva (4 June 2014) and return (16 June 2014). Flights on time; luggage delivered promptly; cheerful and hard-working FAs throughout making several juice and water runs on the long-haul flights. YVR-MUC and return: A330-300 with 2+4+2 seat layout. Two proper meals served the usual chicken or stuffed pasta as the mains (and for overnight flight YVR-MUC an omelette as the second meal). The main problem with A330 and A340 aircraft generally is poor seat design in economy. Window seats leave a 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage wasting space and very uncomfortable for anyone trying to lean against the fuselage to sleep. The two outboard seats (window plus aisle) are supported by two central stanchions that rob passengers of foot space. No standard carry-on bag will fit under the seats in front and more foot space is taken up by entertainment boxes. YVR-MUC flight had these problems. However MUC-YVR return flight had a new A330 interior with far better seat design: it still left the 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage but the two supporting stanchions were at the very ends of the pair of seats leaving proper foot space and enough room that two full-sized carry-on bags could be placed under the seats in front if desired. AVOD offered a vast array of films music and television programs (even binge-watching programs like the complete first season of the US House of Cards). MUC-GVA and return: E195 with 2+2 layout with seats more comfortable than on an A330. Even a sandwiches-and-drinks service for these one-hour flights. Trip rating would be 8 for the old A330 seating 10 for the new A330 seating.
1981,,Hoefle Walter,Austria,1st July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Lufthansa has an excellent first class product. The seat and bed comfort is excellent. Caviar is still served but the portions tend to get smaller than before. The wine selection is always interesting. Food is good but the offer in the first class lounge in LAX not up to European first class standard. In the on board entertainment you might not find the latest films but it's a good cross selection. The atmosphere and color scheme of the newly designed cabin is very pleasant. Bathrooms are bigger on the 380 than on the 747. The content of the amenity bag is rather disappointing. Selection of reading material is good although I would prefer some travel or culinary magazines. The friendly staff will generally address you by name.
1982,,K Beckhaus,Germany,1st July 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH415 IAD-MUC 3 June 2014. It was easy to upgrade last minute. In business class it was a very comfortable flight overseas. The aircraft was clean staff were very friendly and perfectly reserved at the same time space was sufficient with having one of the new seats which can be moved almost completely horizontal and the food and beverages were fine as well. LH is definitely my preferred airline between Europe and America.
1983,,C Schultz,Germany,30th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,MUC-LAX on May 19 in a newly refurbished A340-600. Passenger handling at the airport was superb pick-up from aircraft escort to lounge passport formalities all done while we relax. The First Cabin was fully booked and we had two stewards taking care plus the cabin chief checking in occasionally. Aside from the splendid service like in a gourmet restaurant our crew was very cordial and made sure our time was as enjoyable as possible. The only downside I can remember is that the air-conditioning was quite draughty and could not be reduced.
1984,,F Appel,United States,30th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH431 6/21 to 6/27. Inbound was via BRU with LH1006 and UA973. I travelled FC from ORD to FRA in a B747-8 and it was great. I miss only the small snacks (like nuts sandwiches chips) between the meals. UA is offering these snacks. The FC cabin is quiet comfy and spacious.
1985,,Uwe Langhammer,United States,25th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,LH 439 on A330 DFW-FRA with friendly attentive and professional staff. Nice flight only the old Business Class Seats getting more and more outdated.
1986,,M Molinaro,Italy,25th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH1935 TRS-MUC and LH474 MUC-YUL on Friday June 20th. I usually fly Lufthansa since the local airport near the city I work in is fairly connected with one of its hubs. Even if the flight tickets are a bit expensive I think they provide a reliable service and have a good customer service. Last flight was on the same line an intercontinental one and even travelling economy class you're quite comfortable aboard. I wish the other airlines I use when star alliance partners are not available would provide a similar service.
1987,,Tom Quick,United States,25th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,Flight 464 from Frankfurt to Orlando June 21 2014. Trip started in Istanbul June 21 2014 on flight 1305. We booked our flights 9 months ago. My seat on flight 464 from Frankfurt to Orlando was 39c. I checked in online double checked at the Frankfurt gate still 39 c. Once onboard my seat was given to another who booked late. The new seat was in another section of the plane nowhere near my husband. Since the flight was full the attendants would not move this passenger and were unhelpful. The purser was surly and rude.
1988,,Peter Buchfeld,Germany,25th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH414 MUC-IAD on 15 June 2014. Aircraft great most of the crew were great but there were 2 unfriendly staff members amongst them. Otherwise everything was fine including the weather smooth flight captain's announcements informative and clear. Seat 24C has no legroom due to the partition. The seat itself is ok for economy class but the partition is too close to the knees.
1989,,T Daum,United States,25th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,I am German and used to be a loyal Lufthansa customer. In general it is probably still one of the better Airlines out there but the way they treat the average customer who are just Frequent Traveler status or even less and not Senator or Hon is just plain deplorable. The way they credit now for miles flown tells me that they don't value my business at all anymore. Another annoying thing is the discrimination against carry on bag travelers who are not Gold level. I invested quite some money into a carry on to make sure that it would be in compliance size wise according to international standards and IATA approval but yet I was forced at various occasions to give it up when I was just about to board the flight. The most recent very bad experience I had was when I was just coming off the transatlantic flight from Dulles to Frankfurt and wanted to connect on the domestic flight to Berlin LH 180 on Sunday June 1st at 10.45am. The gate agent ladies serving the desk for that flight were just horrible to say the least forcing me to check my carry on bag  which I had no problem carrying on the transatlantic flight from Dulles to Frankfurt. It's one thing if there are viable reasons for that to do so but being singled out while others were walking by with two pieces of luggage was an experience of discrimination that I never wish to endure again.
1990,,Thomas Schaefer,Germany,25th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 411 on June 10. Perfect Service especially during check-in for return flight from US because I arrived at airport only 35 minutes before departure. Airline personnel were able to manage a direct security check (bypassing the waiting line) a quick transfer to the gate and also the bag arrived on time with the flight.
1991,,Ulrich Herber,Germany,25th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,I flew to Washington with United and returned with Lufthansa. I am disappointed by the differences in service between Star Alliance members. Lufthansa was so much better than United. Everything: food friendliness of staff seats. Below ratings are based on Lufthansa flight only.
1992,,B Sieding,United States,23rd June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,"LH 419 on 1 Jun 2014 from IAD to FRA. The flight was on time the announcements in German and English were clear and understandable. The Inflight Entertainment didn't respond very quick on fingerprints and some of the movies are not particularly new. I saw the same movie-titles on my flight with this airline 8 months ago. They served pasta or chicken for dinner - it's always the same. The bread they served was warm and tasted very well. The little snack for ""breakfast"" didn't knock my socks off. It was better in the past."
1993,,M Florian,Germany,23rd June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,3,yes,6,LH 451. We sat exit row seats in the brand new 747-8. Lots of space entertainment system finally up to date with hi-res displays good selection etc. However lots and I mean lots of restroom traffic. LH went cheap and only installed 2 restrooms for middle section of eco class to cram in 2 more rows (however more legroom on this new plane). Ridiculous and therefor many people waiting in line in front of and around your seat at all times. I always bring my own food since LH and most airplane food in economy is inedible so can't comment on food.
1994,,Robert Redfern,United States,18th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,yes,2,I connected to LH at Frankfurt from a United flight originating at SFO. The arrival and departure at FRA both involved aircraft parked on remote pads and being ferried on stuffed buses to the terminal buildings where insufficient gate space apparently exists. As I was about to get stuffed onto a bus an imperious LH gate agent demanded I surrender the bag in which I carry my CPAP machine. She couldn't have cared less that I was told to keep close hold on it on all my travels and other airport staff have no problem treating it as carry-on. Furthermore there was plenty of bin and underseat space on the flight. Other than that nastiness the flight itself was fine and LH probably deserves its 4-star rating excepting for transfers at FRA.
1995,,Nima Barraci,Germany,18th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,no,3,LH418 8 June FRA-IAD. I am very disappointed by the new flagship of Lufthansa or to be more precise of its Economy Class cabin. While the cabin itself is very comfortable from an environmental point of view - pressure humidity and noise - Lufthansa simply put uncomfortable seats into the great fuselage. They are too hard and there is not enough leg room. Even for an average 1.83m 79kg male sitting in these seats is a pain. The food is just below anything. One does not even need to compare it to the far better airline meals of Air Canada to come to this conclusion. Privileges for Lufthansa status customers are a joke. The Senator lounge in Dulles is more like a shoe box. Only the staff is making the difference as usual. Great staff on board and on ground is the single reason besides the direct connections why I still fly Lufthansa.
1996,,Ld Pierre,United States,18th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH451 on 11 June from LAX to FRA. As usual Lufthansa's service - staff food and entertainment - was excellent though it was a bit tough to get the touch screen to react. The economy seats on the new 747-800 however leave something to be desired. While the legroom is alright the seat is very narrow doesn't recline very much not very comfortable on a 10 hour flight.
1997,,C Paddock,United States,18th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,1,Had awful experience on Flight 428/429 from Charlotte NC to Munich Germany and back. Food and drink ran out before all passengers were served no effort was made to correct the problem. Very unresponsive flight attendants as well as purser. Would never recommend this airline.
1998,,F Bertoni,Brazil,16th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,GRU (Sao Paulo) - FRA (Frankfurt). Impressed with the new Boeing 747-8. Would expect it to be less noisy though. Not a single seat free all three classes were packed. I have to say that the new seat Lufthansa has chosen for this 748 is quite ok far better than the A340-600 one's. Cabin crew ok but a couple of members were everything but polite. Usual long-haul dinner choice (pasta or chicken) usual breakfast. Arrived in FRA 25 minutes before schedule. I keep saying Lufthansa and SWISS beat whatever European airline.
1999,,B Bayes,United Kingdom,16th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,My wife and I booked a return ticket leaving Heathrow to Caracas Venezuela via Frankfurt. The final part of our journey was an internal flight to Barcelona Venezuela where we had planned to visit family. This part of the journey was without incident the return flight was a nightmare. We were due to leave Caracas on May 2013. We started our journey very early leaving to take internal flights from Barcelona to Caracas. Upon presenting ourselves at check in we were informed that our tickets had been accidentally canceled and that it was an internal error of the airline and would be corrected. Another person was called to the desk from the 1st class check in who said that the flights had been cancelled and that we could not travel as a refund had been issued. No explanation was offered and no one knew on whose authority our tickets had been cancelled. We were told the only way we could travel that day was to buy another ticket for nearly £3.000 money which we didn't have available at the end of our holiday. The desk attendants refused to help us in any other way.
2000,,F Bertoni,Brazil,16th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,GRU (Sao Paulo) - FRA (Frankfurt). Impressed with the new Boeing 747-8. Would expect it to be less noisy though. Not a single seat free all three classes were packed. I have to say that the new seat Lufthansa has chosen for this 748 is quite ok far better than the A340-600 one's. Cabin crew ok but a couple of members were everything but polite. Usual long-haul dinner choice (pasta or chicken) usual breakfast. Arrived in FRA 25 minutes before schedule. I keep saying Lufthansa and SWISS beat whatever European airline.
2001,,James Wallace,United States,13th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Munich to Chicago in Economy on an Airbus A340-600. Fasten seatbelt sign turned off five minutes after take-off and not put back on until 30 minutes before landing. Hot towels provided before lunch and after snack. Real tableware used with the lunch not plastic. Free alcohol provided before lunch wine with dinner and two choices of after dinner drinks provided. Five economy toilets were provided in the basement of the plane which was a nice stretch and avoided bad smells in the cabin. Cabin crew were professional and friendly. The seats are very tight luckily the seat next to me was empty. However the flight was nearly full.
2002,,Gerwin Arthur,Poland,13th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,LH431. Service and food was good. I travelled with my wife and it was good that we could book two separate seats at the back of the plane so other passengers would not disturb us during the sleeping period.
2003,,Niewel Manuela,Germany,13th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH431 ORD-FRA 3/6/14. Aircraft and flight were excellent however the cabin crew were not satisfactory. Service was quite slow and at the same time quite hectic crew were a bit unfriendly did not come back after a request when I went into the galley they at first ignored me talking to each other. On the flight to Chicago this was completely different LH430 30/5/14.
2004,,Tegelkamp Doris,Germany,12th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,LH 430 7/6/14. As usual cabins were very clean tidy and everything was in extremely good condition. Service as usual very good attentive and friendly. The vegetarian meal was also very good same for the beverages. Considering we were in economy class even the wine was good. The snack prior to landing is not tasting good and of low quality. A simple sandwich with cheese or a soup (pumpkin tomato) would be better and taste better.
2005,,Georg Konstanznig,United States,12th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1,no,1,June 8th - flight LH450 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. After take-off when the aircraft was at cruising altitude I needed to visit the bathroom. The flight attendant advised me in a very rude way to get back to my seat. We asked for wine during the flight and were advised to wait for the next service. LH crew usually walks through the aircraft with water etc. This crew did not. The food they served was not good. Overall LH450 flight on Sunday June 8th was the worst experience I have had with Lufthansa.
2006,,Buettner Thomas,Germany,10th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,"Flight LH 408 from Dusseldorf to Newark on April 26th and from Chicago to Dusseldorf on May 10th 2014. Both Planes had the same 2-4-2 Seating in Economy Class and are equipped with the new RAVE IFE-System. Seat Pitch is 32 inch and width 17.5 inch which is ok for ""midsized"" Travelers. Tray table is fixed in the frame of the seat so it doES not shake if the Person in front is moving. Wide selection of Movies (up to date or older) Music or other Inflight Entertainment. Beverage Service frequently (also during the night flight back to Dusseldorf) first served approx. 20 minutes after take off. Lunch was the typical ""Chicken or Pasta"" my choice was Chicken which was a Curry Chicken and quite good. Flight Attendants were all nice and offered a solicitous service. Breakfast on the flight back was a little bit ""well arranged"" could be served a little bit more. Anyway it was a quite comfortable trip in economy class."
2007,,F H Koehler,Germany,10th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew from TXL to MUC with LH. As 4U operates almost all flights from TXL nowadays - having a LCC service - I am always glad to get on a LH flight. The flight was very early in the morning with no delay and very quick check-in at TXL. The service - even if decreased over the years - was including snack and drinks not worth complaining. Good things at LH are the seat comfort being better then with the usual LCC at SXF e.g. and a very good choice of newspapers. As for a rather short flight I really enjoyed the flight and prefer it over other airlines.
2008,,Jeff Michel,Switzerland,10th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,4,yes,10,ZRH-FRA-GOT. No problems with the flights (although first one a bit delayed). Staff attentive and efficient and planes clean and neat. The sandwich they serve is Economy for the flight is Mozzarella Egg Plant and Aubergine! What on earth makes them think that this is a good combination and why not just serve a cheese sandwich? Judging by the amount of them left by passengers this is a common view point. Overall very good service but trying a little too hard to make a basic sandwich snack into something almost inedible.
2009,,Michael Carlson,United States,10th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,JFK-MUC. Always a pleasant flight on Lufthansa. However I thought the seats seemed narrower then on previous flights. Not as much seating room. Food was also not as good as usual. Breakfast was kind of chintzy. Or maybe I just don't like muffins for breakfast. Also not as many movies or TV shows to choose from.
2010,,Buettner Thomas,Germany,10th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,"Flight LH 408 from Dusseldorf to Newark on April 26th and from Chicago to Dusseldorf on May 10th 2014.

2011,,Metz Ulrich,Germany,9th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,yes,6,Check-in ok flight was ok but 40 minutes late. Service was friendly. The flight information did not work at all on any screens. I would have expected to get more spoken information during the flight. General: The reduced crediting of miles by booking class is not customer friendly at all. Special upgrade programs: I never succeeded in getting an upgrade to business class with miles online typically a message appears: Not available no matter when.
2012,,C Mayr,Austria,8th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,3,yes,8,MUC-BRU on A319 and E195 flight from Munich was very comfortable as the leg space was very good. Flight was on time and the friendly cabin crew served a tasty sandwich and full bar service. Return flight on E195 was one hour late due to late income of the aircraft. I was always a big fan of the Embraer plane but this time I was very disappointed. The seats are cramped and not at all comfortable. Cabin crew again was very friendly. Lufthansa is a very good and reliable airline in my opinion.
2013,,Tommy Desmet,Belgium,5th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,MUC-BRU in June 2014. Flight was delayed with about 15 minutes due to late arrival from WAW. Cabin clean and comfortable on this Embraer 195 jet. Excellent crew again drinks and tasty sandwiches were offered on this short flight with a smile. To be recommended!
2014,,Jonathan Turner,Germany,5th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,10,I was lucky to receive a complementary upgrade to business Class for my flight FRA-LAX. As usual in Lufthansa Business Class the service was excellent personnel always polite and attentive. The inflight entertainment was of best quality in terms of hardware but fell behind competitors in breadth of offering where eg Singapore even in economy has at least 5 times the amount. Lufthansa's service is more conservative than eg Virgin which suits my personal tastes more. I paid for a flexible economy class ticket for the trip FRA-LAX returning JFK-FRA which was in my view expensive but LH was the only carrier able to offer non-stop on both legs - so LH scores again over competitors in this case on global reach. In the past I have been a regular international flyer with LH having had Senator status for at least 10 yr. However this has lapsed and I have recently been travelling mostly as an economy passenger. Accordingly I cannot accurately compare the current standard of LH business with many other competitors with the exception of Singapore and Emirates who unfortunately offer better seat comfort and entertainment. The aircraft on LH450 was a 747-8 which offered less seat breadth in the reclining position than the A380s of Singapore and Emirates.
2015,,Spyridon Tzamtzis,Greece,5th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 475 31 May 2014 from Munich Germany to Vancouver Canada. The airplane interior of this Airbus A330 is modern and the entertainment system significantly improved comparing to the one fitted in most of the long haul airplanes of the company. Probably they start updating the outdated entertainment system used for in the last 5 years which was famous for its poor performance poor quality of video instability of system and small number of choices when it comes to movies and music. The food is good in terms of quality and quantity. The stewardesses are friendly and make you feel comfortable. The seats in economy class are narrow offering limited inclination of the back. Very uncomfortable definitely below average comparing to other big players like Qatar Emirates Singapore Turkish. Finally as always Lufthansa arrived on time.
2016,,Simeone Enrique,Belgium,4th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,5,"IST-FRA-EZE-SAO-FRA-TLV Fra Tlv &st class on European legs ISt Fra and Fra TLV very average business class tatty seats and not such a good check in both ground and board staff ""don't give a damn attitude"" 1st class to EZE and from Sao to Fra brilliant both 747 400 and 747 800 even better layout Both lay outs are great. Good service even for a full cabin. 8 pax total anyway. will try them again. will recommend only 1st class their C class much to be desired. Problem with bags in all stopovers terrible handling service even for 1class pax. This must be improved."
2017,,Tom McIntosh,United States,4th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,We flew LH 437 ORD to DUS on May 15th followed by LH 2706 DUS to HAM. The planes were nice the seats quite comfortable the food on Flight 437 decent and the flight attendants pleasant. We would fly Lufthansa again for sure.
2018,,Michael Thumm,United States,4th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I had my last flight with Lufthansa on LH430 from Frankfurt/Germany to Chicago on 05/31/14. We had a new 747-800 which was really nice! Also came with some reasonable space for the legs in Economy (I am 189cm tall) however all the seats in new airplanes today look good but completely lack lumber support. Very good and friendly service! Good food and no additional charges did apply for a glass of wine! Keep that up Lufthansa! Also very clean and friendly looking airplane. And finally many choices for the entertainment program (movies) - very good! However I will never understand why Lufthansa does not enable the program once passengers are boarding and leaves it running until at the arrival gate. Most people use their own headphones anyway.
2019,,Marre Rodrigo,Chile,4th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,"I have made at least 8 business class segments in long haul flights in Lufthansa in the last 12 months and can certainly say that the service is poor. The 747-400 that I flew from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Tokyo are old the business class is in bad shape the seats are uncomfortable and have the most uncomfortable inclination. The entertainment system is outdated and limited. Catering is at economy class level. Service is no better especially on the flights to Buenos Aires flight attendants appear tired uninterested in helping and some just plain rude. Service is slightly better on the flight I took to Tokyo and Hong Kong to Munich which makes me wonder if the Latin American market is just less interesting for this carrier. In any event the crew attitude appears in general as ""just do not bother me"" never a reply to the call button. I am a frequent business flyer and definitely regret to have chosen this airline and will avoid using this service again if I can. One final comment headphones are attached to the seats and on two flights I had to take the headphones covers that had been left from a previous passenger in order to put the new ones provided to me that is definitely not good service and not a good hygiene standard."
2020,,Carla Conti Baker,Italy,4th June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,Flying with Lufthansa is always a positive experience to me: reliable punctual efficient. I recently flew from Frankfurt to Los Angeles flight 450 Economy class and on my return flight LH 453 from Los Angeles to Munich I was able to upgrade to Business class by using my Miles and More account. Compared to the Economy class the Business class seats are very comfortable allowing to stretch completely and have a nice rest so that the flight time seems to be much shorter. Also the connecting flights to Verona Italy with Air Dolomiti were perfectly on time. I only wish that the fares to fly in Business class were not so pricy i.e. more affordable then I would book all my travels with Lufthansa in Business class.
2021,,Dominik Löber,Germany,3rd June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,yes,5,I was flying from Washington DC to Frankfurt on Sunday May 25 with Flight LH 419. Good Seats Food was terrible Service was not good (I was not greeted by the purser as a Senator & Star Alliance Gold Member) Inflight entertainment very outdated (small screens).
2022,,B Ziegahn,United States,2nd June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,May 26 2014 LH 431. Good service and food. Nice inflight entertainment with seatback video screens. Not overly impressed with frequent flyer program - having to pay more in taxes for free flights than with other airlines. The seats on this flight had adequate legroom but were narrower and lacked the softness of older aircraft's.
2023,,M Marte,United States,2nd June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1,no,1,Flew yesterday from Munich to LAX. Seats arranged in bulkhead 8 months ago only to find agent and Seatguru were wrong (6ft long legged female). We kept getting delivered special meals which we hadn't ordered nearing identical each time which were just as bad as the regular meals zero air-con in our section very grumpy attendants many people in our section asked about the air-con but nothing was done. If you stood near the galleys to get some air you were greeted with nasty attendants wanting to know why were we up. Very odd customer service.
2024,,Jochen Ottersbach,Germany,2nd June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,Flight LH 431 on 05/26 ORD - FRA we flew first class on the new 747-8. New seats are comfortable. service was what you should expect in first class and food was good. Purserette only briefly greeted the paxs and never was seen again even after the flight had landed in FRA. Her English was terrible.
2025,,W Pierson,United States,2nd June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,1,no,4,LH458 MUC to SFO A340-600. Business class without the new seats actually a rather inferior product and the new seating needs to be much better. Mediocre food with a veal dish for the first meal that consisted of two bites of dry overcooked meat. The meal before landing consisted of curry wurst and a small salad. Really German food is great but curry wurst as the featured food on a $5000 round-trip ticket? Service was sufficiently warm and efficient. In sum Lufthansa will reliably get you from point to point (as long as the pilots are not on strike) but it's really an inferior product (a recent Delta business class flight from ATL to Madrid was far superior in every way e.g. food comfort service).
2026,,R Baumgartner,Austria,2nd June 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I flew on May 26th 2014 with LH 415 from Washington Dulles to Munich. Stewardesses were very friendly and also flexible to help me to change my seat after boarding. Meals were ok but not as good as on Austrian Airline flights.
2027,,Multanowska Agnieszka,Poland,29th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,LH414 MUC-IAD on May 26. Airbus A330 with quite comfortable seats in economy class. On board service providing variety of food very good choice of beverages. Overall service of good quality. Staff friendly and helpful to passengers. Somehow limited entertainment choice.
2028,,F Martin,Austria,29th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,LH 424 Munich - Boston. The Lufthansa Economy product provides mostly ok standards. Current economy seats are nearly the same (bad) experience as for every airline. Preferred check-in and Lounge due to Airline status do make the pre-flight procedures a good experience. For this particular flight crew were very attentive serving additional drinks throughout the flight. The inflight entertainment system could use a few more recent films. On time landing and overall no issues.
2029,,Georg Zechner,Austria,29th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,6,MUC-EWR economy was a great flight on a 340-600. But the return leg from YUL-FRA was a disappointment. Old 340-300 no USB chargers a terrible screen late departure and arrival without explanation and dinner was served by only 2 teams for the entire economy class one by aisle which means that we in the back (row 42 of 27 or so) got ours an hour after they began. This also meant on a 7 hour flight that there was little time between dinner and breakfast. In flight entertainment is pretty poor - 3 weeks between the flights and they were still showing the same episodes of TV shows. Food was nothing special especially the breakfast was an overly sweet muesli bar a muffin and some fruit. So a mixed bag. The crew was ok though.
2030,,Anthony Gibbons,New Zealand,29th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,Rio to Barcelona via FRA. Had already travelled 17 hours from NZ before taking Lufthansa but crew were warm efficient. Could see I was looking fatigued even on departure and crew got everyone fed and watered soon after 10pm take off. In first row of economy on 744 which meant no one could recline into my face! Seat ok and legroom in first row restricted by bulkhead. IFE didn't work in my row but not fussed as tired (purser handed out 25 euro voucher to use on return to Rio. Appreciated). Teriyaki chicken a strange choice out of Rio (impression coloured by horrible experience of teriyaki chicken on Hawaiian) but tasted better than looked. Campari enjoyed as aperitivo and Baileys as digestivo. Previous LH experiences have been lacklustre but felt the crew were personable and not the usual robots. All in all v satisfied. LH is a reliable airline offering great service and fair prices. Look forward to return flight to Rio this weekend but bound to be full of football fans pre World Cup!
2031,,MacMillan David,United Kingdom,29th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,EWR to DUS on refurbished A340-300 2 class aircraft then A321 to Munich. Efficient check in in Newark pre- boarding for business class. Good cabin ambience and nice new seating with variable firmness option. Area for feet when fully reclined relatively narrow but seat length good for tall person. Very good service from a professional crew. Good quiet cabin for night flight. Good food and wine. Large screen and good programming. Very fast and efficient connection in Dusseldorf and nice lounge. Overall a very nice flight- sophisticated.
2032,,S Rasmussen,Lithuania,29th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew VNO-FRA-CPH on 25/5/14 in Economy Class. On the VNO-FRA sector they served a surprisingly good and filling breakfast I hadn't expected anything at all. FRA-CPH sector staff served a pudding and they came around with drinks twice on this 1:15 flight. Staff were very welcoming. Seats could be softer but still there was plenty of legroom. Frankfurt airport itself is very boring but at least Lufthansa provides free coffee/tea and newspapers in the transit area. Will fly LH Again.
2033,,A Freud,Germany,28th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I had the pleasure to travel on new B747-8i from Frankfurt to Washington Dulles and back to Munich on Airbus - both equipped with the new seats. There's a big difference to the old ones! The seat is stylish and completely flat. Inflight movie selection is great now as well as the earphones. What I like most about Lufthansa is their efficient consistent and very friendly service onboard. The food was like a restaurant. Wine selection fine but could be better and wider. Unfortunately they don't offer cappuccino or espresso. Business lounges are a great plus. Staff at US airports should be trained to be friendlier.
2034,,G Anur Ramakrishnan,India,28th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Good hospitality and food. Landing and take-off were smooth. Air-hostesses / Stewards were friendly and attentive - a welcoming smile goes a long way during a long haul trip . Was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to Business Class on my connection from Frankfurt to Chennai. Needless to say the long tiring 9 hour flight was reduced to a very enjoyable one due to the excellent service in Business class.
2035,,Kjeld Buelow,Denmark,26th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,1,"Flew Business Class - Frankfurt-Shanghai and Shanghai-Munich. This is not Business Class at all. The inclined flat beds are hard and it is not possible to lie on the side due to the curve of the leg rest. The food was at best ""better tourist class"" lukewarm and without any finesse at all. With the exception of a New Zealand white the wines were simply lousy. Very little selection. Will never fly Lufthansa Business Class Again."
2036,,R Kunst,Namibia,25th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Johannesburg-Frankfurt. Excellent flight albeit economy on A380 and there was ample space for stowing hand luggage. Staff efficient and very friendly to start off a drink and some pretzels then dinner service (chicken or pasta) with drinks again coffee and liquor breakfast included scrambled eggs. Seat comfort not bad considering it was economy entertainment worked fine with big selection of movies. All in all a very good experience.
2037,,M Lam,New Zealand,25th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,YVR-FRA 747-400. Flight delayed due to late arrival but made up for time. Crew efficient and professional except for one FA. Saw me trying to unsuccessfully help an elderly lady put her luggage in the overhead compartment. Bag was too large and FA just ignored us. Meals were average. IFE had limited selections. Aircraft was clean.
2038,,Lucy Rowe,United States,25th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,yes,4,I have flown Lufthansa before and had the best of everything. I picked Lufthansa because of prior satisfaction. If this would have been my first flight with Lufthansa I would have chosen a less expensive more direct flight. I guess everyone has an off day let's hope the flight home will the Lufthansa I love. The crew was as great and professional as ever.
2039,,Phillip Solomon,Canada,25th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,I travelled between FRA and JNB on the A380. Like most I was disappointed that this state-of-the-art aircraft was not equipped with the lie-flat bed even though the website indicated that these flights would have them. Regardless I was able to find some level of comfort (eventually) on the angled beds - one has to play around with it until you find that comfort spot! Service overall was good and efficient and the food was fine as far as airline food goes. Nothing fantastic but then again nothing too bad.
2040,,Markus Schugens,Germany,23rd May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,7,Aircraft was clean and up to date. Lufthansa service was good as usual. There was a new entertainment system available that was more user friendly than the old one and provided more choice. The problem with the entertainment system were the headphones: the volume could not be adjusted so that all dialogues in movies were understandable.
2041,,B Pate,Australia,23rd May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Singapore to Frankfurt on Airbus A380 a very pleasant journey. The business class seat was comfortable. The entertainment selection was good. The meals were well presented and tasty with a good selection of wines on offer. The service was excellent.
2042,,S Kolping,Germany,21st May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I notice a lot of improvement at Lufthansa as they want to reach 5 star status. Hong Kong - Frankfurt boarding well organized. New Boeing 747-800 good Economy seats and improved inflight entertainment selection. Even a menu card in Economy Class. Food was really good for this service class. First a dinner with Asian or European selection and before landing hot breakfast. They should improve the presentation of the hot dish (tray and extras are fine) and serve warm bread these are always cold and hard. Beverage selection extraordinary. Staff very professional friendly efficient and helped mothers with their kids. I think it's an excellent airline when travelling with a child. There should be more lavatories in Economy class. No amenity kit. Blankets and specially pillows of high quality with real feathers. Plane change to Madrid in Frankfurt: Arrival in the new terminal aera Z hassle free and smooth. Plane to Madrid full. Another hot breakfast was served. Crew very charming and attentive again. No entertainment system - but's that's okay for short flights. Moving map should be introduced. Swiss has it on board even on intra Eruopean routes. In all great experience professional punctual and I felt very safe. But they have to work on the details for the 5 stars: presentation of hot meals hot bread amenity kit better arrival service in Frankfurt for passengers that don't know this giant airport. And entertainment system on short flights.
2043,,Ariel Avitan,Israel,20th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,The flight was OK. The seats were not comfortable and no preferred seats for Senators were offered to me. Food was OK. The flight attendants were good. The entertainment system was stuck for a while and the PA system was very loud.
2044,,B Neumann,United States,20th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,1,I used to have very high expectations on Lufthansa which was wiped out with my recent business with them. The flight attendants were rude and never responded to call lights instead they turned it off without responding and I have to get to the galley each time for a cup of water. Mine was a long intercontinental flight with total of 19 hrs flights. The seats are congested and old. Poor quality entertainment system one of headphone speakers not working replaced with another one with without much difference. My 2nd flight was delayed almost 70 mins.
2045,,Colin Pay,United Kingdom,20th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,LHR-FRA MUC-LHR A319 out A320 return. Both flights left on time 20 minutes late arriving at LHR due to air traffic not the airlines fault. Crews very good. Beer and sandwich both legs.
2046,,V Peang,United Kingdom,19th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,ABZ-FRA-BKK return. Good start to the journey with priority (Business Class Check-in) since I am an FT member. Skipped past a very long queue. 2 luggage of 23 kg checked-in was a nice touch. ABZ-FRA was full good service by the crew with snack and beverage. Not plenty for 2 hrs flight though. Access to Business Lounge is a nice way to spend 2.5 hrs transit with food and plenty to drink as well as shower! FRA-BKK flight was not full and managed to get 2 seats free so get some living spaces for the next 11 hrs. Great crew with smile and helpful. The only downsides are the too hard thin seat for long haul flight and poor selection of entertainment. Departure flight's aircon was set to too warm made it quite hard to get to sleep but it was a one-off fault. Return flights great. Food is more than average. Quite pleased with it. Overall a very good experience with rooms to improve. Definitely recommend Lufthansa especially when the fare is very competitive.
2047,,A Bittermann,Germany,19th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,FRA-BKK with onward flight on Thai Airways to SYD. Excellent service by ground staff and cabin crew. Food was outstanding and I managed to sleep throughout the flight. Return flight connecting from SIN on SQ970. BKK-FRA also in F then FRA-HAM in Business. Again a good overall experience though I have to comment on the ground services upon my arrival in FRA. The flight was delayed and it was almost impossible to get to the next gate on time. I would have expected some kind of assistance by LH ground staff in order to make my connection. Other airlines offer this service even to their business class passengers. This could certainly be improved. Both long haul flights were on a A340 with the old First Class.
2048,,M Awatramani,Switzerland,19th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,For transit Munich Airport was good. The flight from Zurich to Munich was good with good service. The next flight from Munich to Vancouver was good too only I didn't like the food choice and the way they presented it. If you can improve little on food variety it will be really good.
2049,,O Gross,Germany,19th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,Overall great Service from assistance at the ticket counter upgrading to Business Class on miles to the service on board. Check in was efficient for Business Class.
2050,,Christopher Brandt,Germany,19th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,New Business class is worth flying. Lufthansa made a big improvement at inflight service. Nevertheless the service at the check-in desks in the US need to be improved. Overall it seems Business class is getting better while Economy is getting worse. So for Long flights you should think about upgrading or buying Business from the beginning.
2051,,J Brueckel,Germany,17th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,1,"Overall a very good product in First Class. Ground service at other airports is not on the same level as Frankfurt or Munich but that's to be expected. Food quality is good but could still be improved. One point I would like to critique is that the drinks menu promises a choice of champagne but usually there is only one of the choices on board. While I was never dissatisfied with the champagne that was offered it annoys me to be offered a choice only to hear that there really is no choice. Another points I would like to make is about the inflight entertainment system. First off I have to say that it has improved tremendously on the content side. Sadly there is still no improvement on the user input side which is very unresponsive and on the design of the ""Lufthansa Media World"" is still confusing and overly complex. Service from the flight attendants was very good but felt a bit scripted and unenthusiastic. The seat is excellent for lounging as well as sleeping and has plenty of adjustment options. A nice extra for the seat would be a massage function like you get on Swiss First and many other competitors."
2052,,Krzysztof Majczak,United States,17th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,I rated Food and Beverages less than perfect” because of the chicken being served : I'm allergic even to the odor of it. Seats less than perfect” because on the flight to Europe the spacing was very tight return was much better a newer airplane model. Due to all the security checks and their cost my last trip overall experience is a far cry from how pleasurable traveling used to be thus rating is less than perfect but I need to admit that Lufthansa personnel makes all efforts to make the nuisances as painless as possible. New Airbus model touch screen entertainment -– simply the best and the easiest; especially the flight tracking!
2053,,Kurt Kaibel,Germany,17th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,,,3,no,2,LAX-FRA. Seats 45 B+C was poor with faulty design of folding tables. The rice and vegetables at dinner were overcooked Digestif service was too quick the bread rolls were served very cold and only on request. During the sleep / overnight period an night inadequate supply of drinks (2 times in the cabin to offer water only). There was no distribution of Toblerone. On our outward flight LH 452 all was great - 5 stars!
2054,,R Graeber,United States,16th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,A330 FRA-IAD business class. LH's business class product on this aircraft is unacceptable. I never thought I'd say United beats them in every respect - but on this flight they did. Angle-flat uncomfortable seat. Ridiculously clunky AVOD with poor selection. Food - geez. Bite size piece of veal. No easily accessible headphone jack? Seat barely worked - had to wiggle the switches back and forth many different ways to get the seat to recline. A failed experience in every respect. I had a fully flexible C class fare booked on UAL and to get home two hours earlier switched to this flight. While it was nice to see the family 2 hours earlier I was astonished at how poor this product is. I hope (and am sure) that the 747-8 and other newer airplanes are better - this thing needs to be retired.
2055,,Riccardo Innocenti,,16th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,We have a good flight with Lufthansa. The staff was nice and entertainment good. We found some film in our native language. The only remark from my point of view is that on flight LH410 too many people ask the rice as hot food and when it will arrive my turn it has finished (should happen) but the staff remember at the second time to serve me first.
2056,,K Siegers,Germany,16th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,7,Seat and display were not clean. The seat was very uncomfortable and even if I am only of average height there was not even enough space to cross or uncross my legs. I could not move around at all. Unfortunately catching some sleep under these conditions was not possible at all which is really bad for an overnight flight from Boston to Munich. Also the restroom was in really bad condition (thanks to fellow travelers who obviously do not know the basic rules of etiquette) I liked the touch screen of the inflight entertainment system which responded really well and delivered really good picture quality and the staff was really friendly as always.
2057,,Olivia Keller,United States,13th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,8,LH 422 and 425. Boston - Munich and Frankfurt - Boston. Improvement in staff: kind and welcoming. On the downside the entertainment program did not offer a wide range of movies selection is also difficult as it does not have a flexible menu. Meals are repetitive for frequent flyers.
2058,,T Verhaeghe,Belgium,13th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,7,Brussels-Munich-Seoul. First flight excellent. Surprised to get a sandwich coke and tea on such a short flight. FA's very friendly. Munich to Seoul on the A340-600. Plane pretty old but well kept. Food was good: hot dinner and hot breakfast. Some FA's very friendly some pretty robotic. Poor entertainment system but still good enough to get me through the flight. Excellent value for money.
2059,,Jefferson Ingrid,Germany,13th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,LH414 May 10 2014. The flight was ok but here are some comments: Seat is not as comfortable as United Airlines. I liked that the amenity kit was event specific (soccer world championship). Many seats were empty in business class but I had a neighbour. The entertainment system is better now but there is still room for improvement. Too many old movies.
2060,,F Bertoni,Italy,12th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,Just flew Munich - Sao Paulo on a A340-600. Flight was packed. Very attentive and nice cabin crew: I did ask for a sleeping mask was told it is meant for business class passengers. But I got one delivered 3 minutes later: very nice touch. Cabin crew almost all young men kept asking passengers if everything was fine. Food quality ok nothing special. Selection of movies on the IFE good but have seen better. The worst thing on this A346 was the seat: way too narrow to have some good sleep on this 12.50 hrs trip. Overall Lufthansa is still my number one choice when flying throughout Europe or to US/South America.
2061,,Goran Stevanovic,Serbia,12th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,5,The flight was 3 legs: flight from Tampa FL to Belgrade Serbia. These flights were operated by United (Tampa to Washington DC) and 2 flights on Lufthansa. Even though the system on both Lufthansa and United showed that I could do an online check-in within 24 hours of the first flight and select seats - I was not able to do so. Systems are just not connected even they market this as a Star Alliance. It is a shame that it is not possible to choose seats online and that systems are not connected within the alliance.
2062,,Simon Summers,Austria,12th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,no,6,VIE-FRA-HKG Business Class on an A321 then top deck on the new 747-800 with new business class seats. All flights on time. First leg acceptable although no IFE/moving map and food service was merely a tray of small but tasty canapes. On the flight to HKG must say that the new business class seats are very narrow and not particularly comfortable to sleep in. There's also no privacy screen between seats. Meals were acceptable although on both occasions my first choice was not available which I found strange being in the middle of a half-empty cabin. Service is functional/automated not very warm and cabin crew didn't appear happy to serve unlike SIA/Emirate/others. The IFE monitors were not sharp high resolution like onboard new Austrian business class. All in all would rate 6/10. Don't expect anything special it's not 4* service. LH's strengths are VFM and reliability so you can count on getting from A-B on time and a reasonable price if not in luxury.
2063,,Markus Reithwiesner,Germany,12th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,"LH419 May 7. Enjoyed the new First Class: Food Service and Amenities were excellent like the new seat more than the ""private cabin"" approaches of some Arab or Asian airlines. Recent service upgrades are notable upgraded entertainment system in the new 747-8 includes Box sets of TV shows which I like."
2064,,M Wu,United States,11th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,,3,no,2,On a direct flight Munich to Los Angeles I found myself in row 39 (economy class) of an aircraft with a downstairs bathroom area. The bathroom configuration is a great innovation but next to my seat loomed the very imposing cover for the stairway to the bathroom. Mine was the inside seat of only two in that row because of the stairway. My elbow bumped into the stairway wall and my vision was totally blocked on that side. Claustrophobic alley! A kind attendant was able to reseat me. Meals? The plane departed at noon and lunch was served at 1 pm. Lufthansa has been touted for its meals and I was looking forward to this part. The meal itself was good from my experience with airplane food. A few hours later an attendant passed out Toblerone chocolate bars. Several hours after that more chocolate bars. Mind you this was a direct flight. It landed 12 hours after it departed. The passengers had last eaten a meal 11 hours earlier! I think most people would need at least a sandwich or light meal in that 11-hour period. There were no meals for purchase on board no help in sight. I think Lufthansa definitely needs to look carefully at their meal policy for such extended flights. If I ever travel on this airline again I'm bringing my own food!
2065,,Ansorge Michael,Germany,11th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,LH 457 LAX-FRA: The design of the new Lufthansa first class (Boeing 747-800) is very good and the service was excellent. High quality standards!
2066,,D Gandhi,India,11th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,A330-300 was clean The staff was courteous the AVOD monitor with its Camera and gave a true picture of aircraft position and terrain. I like their Chanel 5 for Pop music.
2067,,D Kusiak,Sweden,11th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Third return flight with LH First Class product. This time MUC-EWR on board A 340-600 and back on 747-400 EWR- FRA. LH First Class is absolute perfection. From ground staff through flight service to after touch down. It's a completely different way of air travel. It's expensive of course but you know exactly what you're paying for. Besides that it's even better when First Class is an upgrade.
2068,,John Clark,United States,11th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,2,We were scheduled to fly out of SFO on April 3rd UA1169. Then to Addis Ababa on April 4th: LH419. Unfortunately we were not notified of the pilots strike until Wednesday afternoon April 2nd. We went to the SFO airport on April 2nd and were unable to obtain alternate flights that day. After several hours Lufthansa scheduled us to go through Seoul Hong Kong and on to Addis. However in the arrangement the last leg of our return flight on May 3rd had been deleted from the Lufthansa reservation list. The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles. That flight left and arrived on time. Then we found we had no reservation from LAX to FAT. It was not a good experience! I have flown Lufthansa for 40 years and will continue to do so however this trip was not good for us.
2069,,Lautwein Christof,Germany,10th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,3,yes,8,DUS-EWR. Lufthansa has improved many things in the past which was also more than necessary nothing to complain on this flight crew was also unusual friendly. The new business class seats are another big improvement. Not yet top-class but I was quite happy with everything.
2070,,Michiko Bickelman,United States,8th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,May 5. Flight LH 430 from Frankfurt to Chicago. I was little bit disappointed because the TV did not work and the foods I wanted were out. But other than that services were good.
2071,,Ferrante Enrico,Italy,7th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,LH410 3rd May 2014. Good quality and price unfortunately the temperature of the cabin was too low. Several passengers required to increase the temperature to the crew without satisfaction. Low rating for seat comfort is related to this reason.
2072,,Adam Heinz-Hermann,Germany,7th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,LH456 on May 4. This was a standard Trip on Lufthansa's Boeing 747-8i and the exit row window seats in economy are almost perfect for a daytime intercontinental flight. The entertainment systems performance was a little sluggish first but recovered the longer I used it. Food was OK for Economy service was as you expect from Lufthansa. As a premium customer you get individually greeted here and they even offered to bring a round of premium drinks from the Business class selection. The only pain point was that one of the lavatories was broken so the lines were bothersome all the time. I wonder why such a Premium plane does not get fixed before heading from FRA to LAX.
2073,,Ken Davis,United States,6th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,2,yes,2,FRA-IAH on 4/14 diverted to DFW due to weather problems in Houston. Arrived DFW around 4 pm was told only option was to take their chartered buses which did not depart until around 10 pm and arrived IAH around 0230. I understand the weather issue but my issue is with the compulsory bus ride when there are multiple flights between DFW and IAH. Why was another flight not an option?
2074,,J Lynch,Canada,6th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,We had two flights in business class from Malaga to Dusseldorf and then to Heathrow. The flights were what we always have (and expect) with Lufthansa. Flights are on time boarded efficiently smiling staff tasty food and a nice sized chocolate treat. Some of the passengers are grumpy and impatient. The staff from Dusseldorf to Heathrow April 12 were some of the best we've encountered. A great sense of humor. No inflight entertainment but there isn't on any of the short flights we've seen in Europe.
2075,,Lech Jan,Poland,6th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,I was travelling from FRA to ORD in economy class on board 747-8. Seat comfort was ok Wi-Fi working well most importantly flight attendants were nice they had good selection of beverages (incl. alcohol like whisky or cognac) ordered special food was really good. So we had good and smooth trip. Satisfied.
2076,,Brandt Sebastian Justus,Germany,5th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Several flights in April: Rome via Munich to Sao Paulo and back from Rio de Janeiro via Frankfurt to Nice. All Lufthansa operated. Consistent quality on all flights: All on time (some ahead of schedule) very professional and courteous employees on board. I don't understand why their cabin crews have a reputation of being cold and robotic. Not true at all. Very service orientated. Seats improved on long haul flights. I liked the new inflight touch screens like an ipad - easy to use large and better variety of movies. Food as always very good departing from Germany and only average from Rio. But beverage service (also alcoholic) excellent nice snacks like Milka chocolate bars in the galleys throughout the flight. Airbus A340-600 much quieter and nicer to fly than even refurbished 747-400 back from Rio. Munich airport simply great to transfer. Frankfurt new Z-area a great plus. Baggage handling despite short connexion time good. Always arrived with us. A great way to fly very recommended!
2077,,G Ron,Canada,5th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,YYZ-FRA-TLV on April 30. YYZ-FRA leg operated by an older 747-400 instead of the usual A340-600. Aircraft was refurbished and offered personal touch screens; seats were rather thin and uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. I ordered a vegan (VGML) meal which included steamed vegetables and plain rice food was ok but lacked proteins and flavour dairy granola bar and margarine were provided which was annoying. Free beer wine and spirits were offered. Staff were courteous and professional. FRA-TLV leg was in a high density A321 seats were about 2 inches thick very hard and uncomfortable for the 4 hour flight. Food was surprisingly good and much better than the YYZ- FRA leg. No entertainment was offered. Service was extremely professional and courteous. Overall pretty satisfied and will definitely fly again.
2078,,R Mahn,Germany,5th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,2,no,5,LH 454 FRA-SFO 16 April 2014. LH 457 LAX-FRA 30 April 2014. Inflight entertainment and movie variety improved. Seat comfort is ok. No major difference to other airlines' economy. Staff service and friendliness is varying between employees. No consistency in friendliness and service. Food and beverage services take very long until guests are served. Breakfast is poor in terms of quantity content and quality. Just one additional beverage service after lunch/dinner. No sleeping masks provided.
2079,,Siddalingappa Siddaraju,United States,5th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Departure LH 431 on April 16th and arrived LH 430 on May 2nd from Chicago O'Hare. Lufthansa had a Boeing 747 for this flight and it was great with individual TV’s for movie watching. Air hostesses had great attitudes and served with a smile. It was refreshing to see a good service throughout and made the long flight bearable. Only suggestion I would make is to provide more and better choices for movies. This is especially critical for long flights.
2080,,Siddalingappa Siddaraju,United States,5th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,Departure LH 431 on April 16th and arrived LH 430 on May 2nd from Chicago O'Hare. Lufthansa had a Boeing 747 for this flight and it was great with individual TV’s for movie watching. Air hostesses had great attitudes and served with a smile. It was refreshing to see a good service throughout and made the long flight bearable. Only suggestion I would make is to provide more and better choices for movies. This is especially critical for long flights.
2081,,Sirianni Carlo,Italy,5th May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,yes,7,"LH 419 from IAD to FRA April 30th. Good Airline in terms of flight schedule and punctuality. Seats are not as comfortable as could be compared to other airlines mainly on intercontinental flights. The recent changes in miles accrual has turned out into a price increase therefore the ""value for money"" index decreases."
2082,,Mority von Laffert,Germany,3rd May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,2,yes,6,May 2nd 2014 LH 413. Excellent cabin service. However I was unlucky in getting one of those ancient First Class cabins with seats which should be in a museum. I think it is unacceptable to offer such a First Class product when many Business class seats of other airlines are way better. The usual new FC is good though but the old one must be replaced.
2083,,M Connaughton,United Kingdom,3rd May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flew MAN-FRA-BOG round trip last week. Overall was I was impressed with Lufthansa and would fly with them again. IFE is good if a little dated. FA's are very professional courteous and friendly. They were helpful with every request that I or other pax around me had. The aircraft (B737 A346 and A320) were clean. I opted for the vegetarian meals and was impressed with taste and quality. My only gripe is the seat pitch in economy. Thankfully I had a spare seat next to me on FRA-BOG outbound otherwise it does feel a bit cramped for a 180cm person like myself. I would travel with Lufthansa again.
2084,,M Kleine,Germany,3rd May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,10,ABZ-FRA-TXL on 737-500 and A320. Lufthansa clearly stands out on European routes for me. 1) All classes include checked luggage and they are generous when it comes to weight limits (I had 28 kg no problem whatsoever). 2) Very generous bar service even between FRA and TXL (50 min flight time) they served drinks twice. There is always a snack and on international routes a proper sandwich which makes a difference with for example BA or Air France where they still serve lousy crackers on international (European) services. 3) The cabin crew are lovely has humour and also treats Economy Customers as important guests.
2085,,R Wintrob,United States,1st May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,9,My wife and I took Lufthansa flights BOS-MUC-DRS on Apr 18 DRS-MUC-GDN Apr 22 and GDN-MUC-BOS on Apr 28. We were very satisfied with the service. All flights were on schedule. Our return flight to BOS arrived early. The check- in procedure was courteous helpful and efficient. Our interactions with all flight attendants was courteous and helpful. We feel safe and confident about flying Lufthansa and would gladly do so in future.
2086,,Kustermann Hubert,Germany,1st May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,4,Very positive experience. Only one major complaint: the distance between the rows of seats is very short. I am only 175 cm tall and weigh 65 kg but feel cramped in when the seat in front me is being reclined back I have no choice other than also tilt my seat back - even if I don't want to. Most other airlines provide better seating arrangements than I experienced on the flight LH 476 on April 28 2014.
2087,,Werhan Peter,Germany,1st May 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,IAD-FRA LH 419 20/4/2014. New 747-8 reduction of engine noise - good. Seating - in view of economy class - good. Meals - breakfast lousy. Cabin crew - morning service started late no prompt to bring the seat back into an upright position for meals. Reaction time of inflight entertainment system very slow.
2088,,Wolf David,Germany,30th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,LH456 and LH9242 on 10 April. Good product and Service - Shared flight with United Airlines was awful (not a thing I was looking for as I booked Lufthansa). Employees were most of the times quite nice. In-Seat-Entertainment in 747-800 works horribly (touch screen). Planes are cleaner than others from other airlines but still somewhat dirty - cleaning should do a better job and crew must check it prior to boarding.
2089,,J Banner,United Kingdom,29th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,4,FRA-SFO LH454 13 Apr 2014. LAX-FRA LH457 25 Apr 2014. First class flight inbound: Seat was broken. System needed to get re-started 4 times during the flight then adjusted manually. Food: salad was unenjoyable. Main course (beef fillet) looked very good but was tasteless. Service onboard not first class at all. Slow and not attentive. Lounge LAX: great facilities. However very thin food offering. Business flight outbound: Entertainment system crashed 3 times. Old business class seats.
2090,,Ralf Bostedt,Germany,28th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 415 IAD-MUC on April 21 2014. This flight offered the cabin service as it used to be with friendly and attentive flight attendants which created a nice relaxing atmosphere. The inflight system was new and worked very well especially when comparing to the e.g. A380 (eco) which are terrible. Flight was very good however it all depends on the crew. I also experienced very bad and disinterested service (lately LH 462 A380 FRA-MIA on April 13 with unclean toilets right from the start and stressed personnel).
2091,,R Deu,Spain,25th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,yes,7,FRA-BCN 22 April Economy award ticket. This was an expensive (paying with miles) ticket from LJU to BCN. The first flight was on Adria and its new CRJ900 aircraft. FRA-BCN was on LH economy departure 4 mins before time bearding with 2 jetways to A321 which is very rare. Cabin crew were just regular. No special attention towards top tiers full flight basic food which included a small sandwich and a drink. Well groomed staff and maintained aircraft. Arrived (touched down) in BCN 6 mins ahead of schedule but lost 20 mins due to taxi and outside parking position even if a lot of gates were empty. Lufthansa is keeping itself above water saving even where savings are impossible charging more for taxes and lowering earning levels of Miles & More. After 25 years and complete dedication to LH I will not re-qualify for Gold status anymore.
2092,,Emily Borowski,United States,24th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,I flew flight 434 from Munich to Chicago (ORD) on their A340. The plane was new beautiful and the flight attendants were pleasant. I had the chicken with rice meal option and it was good. I enjoyed the white wine and the staff was very good about keeping the passengers' glasses filled with water juice or soft drinks. I had the calzone instead of the quiche for the snack prior to landing. It was only okay and I was disappointed that a fork and a knife were not offered with this option. The IFE (in-flight entertainment) options were adequate. During the flight I watched two movies and enjoyed the spa/relaxing music option. To summarize I had a good experience and believe I got good value for my money. I would recommend Lufthansa.
2093,,H Muellerschoen,Germany,23rd April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,It has been a long-haul transatlantic flight in a new 747-8. The baggage drop security check flight and arrival have been uneventful and ok. The service onboard was good but not outstanding. After less than ten rows serviced the choice of meals was already reduced to one (pasta). The quality is comparable to supermarket convenience food and tends to be lower than in previous years - in variety as well as in general quality.
2094,,Jose Antonio Pellicer,Spain,22nd April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 1147 Bilbao - Frankfurt March 31st 2014. LH 440 Frankfurt - Houston March 31st 2014. LH 419 Washington Dulles - Frankfurt April 11th 2014. LH 1142 Frankfurt - Bilbao April 12th 2014. Overall I have to say that I am satisfied with the airline. Lufthansa makes you feel comfortable on most of their trips. I value the professionalism of its workers. The only two issues they should get better are the entertainment onboard in economy class where you find fewer movies compared to other airlines and the new calculations for the mileage system in 2014 which makes it more difficult to retain or gain frequent flyer or senator status unless you spend more money.
2095,,Simeone Enrique,Belgium,22nd April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,yes,7,HND-BRU via MUC 1st class A340-6 full plane in all classes. I am fond of LH but although very convenient HND airport check in was a mess even for 1st class had to wait more than 15 min computer problems staff lacking skills! Used ANA Suite Lounge - excellent! Boarding again messy. Once on board very efficient staff and professional purser. Food not so good and drinks very average. Since it was a day flight sleeping is difficult so watched a few movies and slept a little. Because the connecting time to the BRU flight was tight checked with purser and he assured me that someone was meeting me to go through all fast channels (ie passport control and security) but no one around made it on my own just before closing doors. Purser in short haul flight was apologetic as was check in gate staff. Excuses excuses and more excuses. All in all have the best European First class together with Swiss.
2096,,Flueckiger Bruno,Switzerland,21st April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Flight LH415 Washington Dulles - Munich. Modern aircraft friendly staff very limited space in economy class Food so-so.
2097,,Karl Moosbrugger,Austria,21st April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,FRA-SEA in business. Check-in was quick onboard a friendly crew and good service with tasty meal a snack half way and a warm snack before arrival. The new video system offered lots of choices. Seat was comfortable although I had the feeling they reduced the width compared to the old business seats.
2098,,Bud Dungan,United States,21st April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,I flew business class on A319 from Frankfurt to Erbil and back then to Houston on A380. There was no business seats from FRA to EBL even though they passed it off as business class. Just the same as coach. It was a 4 hour flight. Absolutely dreadful! Then in business class on the A380 the seats do not go horizontal therefore I could get no sleep as my body was being pulled down.
2099,,J Braun,Austria,19th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,no,6,FRA-SIN-FRA on A380 in economy. Flight was cheap left/arrived on time and meals were fine but those were the only real positives. Fortunate to snag a seat with no seat in front so endless legroom. All other seats in economy looked ridiculously cramped. Seat itself was extremely uncomfortable for the 12 hour flight and the constant prodding of the touch screen from the passenger behind is a little annoying. (Unfortunately this is the only way to operate the screen as the remote is basically useless) Entertainment system would have been ok but crashed 3 times. Am Lufthansa 'Senator' status which helped in being able to secure one of the best seats (53D) other than that absolutely no recognition of so called status on board unlike Air New Zealand where one feels welcome pampered and valued - even though it is not my 'home' airline. All in all pretty sad for such a proud airline.
2100,,D Norton,United Kingdom,19th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Madrid to Bogota via Frankfurt. Excellent flight to FRA with good hot breakfast of Spanish omelette and spinach bread and jam with plenty of drinks! Upgraded to business class with my partner using miles. Only issue I have with Lufthansa was the transfer to Terminal C which includes having to exit and go through security once again which is always slow at FRA airport. Senator lounge in C very nice and cosy with direct door access to the gates. Service onboard to Bogota was excellent despite my food choice not being available even third row into the business class. The food portions are smaller but the drinks service made up for that with the crew members being super nice and efficient. I have always enjoyed Lufthansa since 15 years in general but the new miles and status earning system is somewhat disappointing but perhaps necessary with the overcrowded lounges and lack of free seats when using miles.
2101,,Fischer Felix,Austria,16th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,8,LH1233 on 16th of April from Vienna to Frankfurt. The overall flight was good and the flight attendants were friendly. We also got a small snack. The fact that there was absolutely no Inflight Entertainment was no problem due to the short flying time. The only things which disturbed me were that the flight was overbooked and that the online check-in didn't worked till I called the Lufthansa hotline. But all in all I would recommend Lufthansa and look forward for the next flight!
2102,,B Mock,United States,16th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,Frankfurt to Dulles International Airport Washington DC on 13 April - even in economy class. It was such a contrast to the miserable United flight a week before - without doubt the most excruciatingly cramped and uncomfortable flight I have experienced. Seats on Lufthansa were very comfortable and crew outstanding with well- timed efficient food and beverage service. Loved the hot towel service! Only drawback was the frustrating in- flight entertainment system with sluggish touch screens requiring multiple attempts to activate and many movie selections which would not play. The seats were such an improvement over United's that I intend to fly Lufthansa whenever possible from now on even tho' I am a United Mileage Plus member.
2103,,L Hausmann,Germany,16th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 418 on 9th April 2014. I was very satisfied with the overall experience on my Lufthansa flight although I would hope for a few additional movies on the inflight entertainment recent releases in particular. Staff were friendly and meal choices okay. Sometimes offers e.g. for Bailey's/Cognac after meals are only made upon request so you need to pay close attention when a flight attendant comes by. However compared to other airlines I've travelled with so far (e.g. Air France UA US Airways KLM Air Berlin) I'd rate Lufthansa higher than average.
2104,,Puls Alexius,Germany,16th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,30 Mar 14 LH 408 Dusseldorf - New York / Newark. 6 Apr 14 LH 419 Washington Dulles - Frankfurt. Pleasant travel experience. Seats in Economy could be wider and more comfortable.
2105,,Shobana Saraswathan,India,15th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Our flight LH439 DFW-FRA was very pleasant. Punctual and extremely comfortable. The stewardesses were very courteous and efficient. The special Asian Veg Meal was tasty. We look forward to our trip to Europe shortly.
2106,,Roberts David,Belgium,13th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,Brussels to Frankfurt business class March 25. Checked in at Zaventem at the First/Business Class counter with the most miserable agent I have encountered in 30 years of flying. No smile no eye contact no attempt whatsoever to welcome a paying customer. The agent really looked as if he hated every minute of his job. The flight itself was fine on-time with helpful stewards in a half-full plane.
2107,,G Bradbury,Switzerland,13th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Frankfurt to Chicago April 1 outbound and returned on April 6. Good flight with the 747-8. Video system works well but slow to respond to touch commands.
2108,,Robert Renshaw,United States,13th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,My first experience with Lufthansa was outstanding. I expect superior service in business or first class and I expect adequate service in coach/economy the Lufthansa staff from IAH-FRA and FRA-DXB (and back) were extremely pleasant and helpful - with a full cabin they were able to top-level service. I was pleasantly surprised that they maintained their pace for so long. The food was certainly better than most economy fare and the in-flight entertainment provided more than enough options to keep me occupied for nearly 40 hours of flight time on my round trip. I have come to expect average service when booking coach/economy and Lufthansa significantly raised the bar in this area. Now that I know about them first-hand I will look for their flights first when I travel.
2109,,Idra Thernot,Germany,13th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,5,no,1,8 April 14 LH 008 HAM-FRA. Packed flight. Deadheading stewardess decides to dump her 2 (sizeable) pieces of luggage in the overhead bins above the emergency exits instead of taking her stuff to the back of the plane. Result: No space for paying passengers' luggage legroom can't be used (naturally) working stewardess had to rearrange a bunch of bags and coats and spread them throughout the airplane. Paying eco customers are rated lower than deadheads.
2110,,Dago Didier,Switzerland,11th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3,yes,7,LH418 on April 8. Overall trip was good - given the seat I had. Staff service was okay - although some more smiles would have been welcomed. Appreciated personal and named greetings from the chef de cabine coming to the Economy section - thanks to my M&M status. Food was okay. Could have been more appealing for the snack 2hrs before landing. A hot napkin before landing would be a plus. IFE is easy but does not show last movie releases and miss some more language / subtitles options.
2111,,Herzberg Ben,Israel,11th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flew LH490 on April 7 2014. I fly with LH about once a month on a round-trip that involves four segments. Service is always very good and on time performance excellent. New A330 interior in economy class is very convenient with a good entertainment system and ample leg room. I'm very pleased with Lufthansa.
2112,,A Pagan,Greece,10th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,HND-MUC-ATH on A346. 24 hours before I checked in on a seat on emergency exit. I was surprised to find out that they had a different lay out so no extra leg room. Thankfully economy section 30% full so I jumped in the seat in front of the bulk. The seat was quite comfortable. Food and beverages quite good. On time performance. Now on the below par section. The cabin was extremely cold and the blankets were small and thin. Complaints made but nothing changed. IFE a bit old without remote control tough to navigate on a low resolution screen. A worn out touch screen with ok variety on movies though. Poor audio and the headsets completely useless. Cabin crew quite the opposite of ANA crew on my inbound FRA-HND. Actually robotic. No smiles no interaction. They served lunch 30 minutes after take off and then disappeared. Only one of them seated in the galley area with a tray of water and juice on a self service mode. After 9 hours they served a dinner box (again as in lunch there was a choice between Japanese and Western). Priority on my luggage was not honored in Athens as my suitcase came out after 20 minutes waiting on the carousel. All in all a below par flight from LH.
2113,,P Kreft,Switzerland,10th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,"In the past years I have flown with Lufthansa mostly to collect miles but this year they reduced the miles for low fare economy flights from 50% to 25%! Why on earth would I still choose LH? Singapore Airlines has better service much better food more comfortable seats and same or often lower prices than LH. British Airways as well. Who was the genius to introduce this new ""saving"" policy at LH? Anyway they did not give much miles away. I feel like being punished because in the past I chose LH over other carriers."
2114,,Holz Marion,Germany,8th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 418 on March 6 2014. Flight from Frankfurt to Washington DC. Very good service. Travelled with a handicap passenger and was treated very well. Helpful friendly staff not only during check-in but also throughout the flight. Had been afraid of travelling by myself with this passenger but Lufthansa-staff were there for me.
2115,,M Altinkum,Germany,6th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,I flew from Lyon to Frankfurt in Economy. The flight attendants were very friendly the food was okay and on this 1hr flight they served beverages 3 times! Check-in was good and the luggage was there before I was! A very nice flight with good service!
2116,,Rai Siddharth,India,6th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,LH761 New Delhi to Frankfurt 1st Feb 2014. LH400 Frankfurt to New York 1st Feb 2014. LH401 New York to Frankfurt 22nd Feb 2014. LH760 Frankfurt to New Delhi 24th Feb 2014. Good leg room great food above average service and a hygienic environment. The in-flight entertainment was quite a let down. All in all a brilliant airline. One of the best in Europe but no where near the Top 3 Airlines like: Singapore Airlines Qatar and Emirates. But probably one of the best Transatlantic Flights out there especially when travelling from India.
2117,,Robert von Herrmann,Germany,6th April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,2,no,4,I am shocked that LH is planning to do away with the Senator benefit of being able to reserve seating at time of booking. I need an emergency exit seat as I am very tall and LH has had my loyalty for the last 14 years expressly because of this reason. If they allow anyone to reserve the emergency exit seats at any time then why should a passenger remain loyal.
2118,,Thomas Hilbert,Venezuela,2nd April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,yes,7,"CCS-FRA-TXL and return aboard LH FirstClass in March. Inbound flight was excellent A330-300 with new FC. Check in in CCS was a 5 min thing very efficient and friendly. In CCS they use the AA Admirals Club for FirstClass lounge which was average limited drink selection no food not even snacks. Boarding was fast. Crew were nice and caring Seat was comfy but not as comfy as it looks. It's a lie flat where they put a ""mattress"" on but still quite hard to lie on but at least you can stretch out. Food was good but not outstanding. Transit in FRA is a mess CCS flights always got remote parking no gate! You have to climb off the plane get into Van take a 15min ride to Arrivals B then walk 30+ mins through Immigration customs on to Departures A. Senator Lounge at A Gates is like a luxury hotel full breakfast buffet smoking lounge showers full bar and great service. FRA-TXL leg is only 50 mins they put you in Business in lack of a First in these flights. Return flight was scheduled for March 27 but cancelled due to strike. They rescheduled my flight on the phone for March 28 no problem. TXL-FRA left at 6 am on time. Getting from Arrivals A to Departure C in FRA is disgusting. Endless walking (40+ mins) plus a trip on a train for people with moving limitations almost impossible to handle. Senator Lounge at C Gates very good but not as splendid as the one at A Gates I mentioned before. FRA-CCS decent service same food experience ( same menu) same good vodka same "" so-so"" seats. Nice inflight entertainment with large flatscreen good selection of actual movies and TV series. On time arrival in CCS very fast bag service with FirstClass bags unloaded first. Nice experience but not worth the money due to seats and food quality."
2119,,Juergens Franz,Germany,2nd April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 1770 29/3/2014. Two days ago I returned from Istanbul to Frankfurt and this was an example for what has become again standard. Plane was completely full passengers were greeted at the entrance door. Friendly and highly professional was the attitude of the 5 flight attendants. Meal service consisted of a warm dish (chicken with vegetables and wedges) a roll with butter rice pudding and a small bottle of water followed by two rounds of drinks. LH still has one of the most generous choices of free drinks non-alcoholic of any kind plus red and white wine sparkling wine beer etc. Announcements from the cockpit were short clear and informative. The cabin design was okay and clean. Due to the thin recaro seats space is sufficient even for larger people. Lufthansa is definitely on the rise again.
2120,,Anna Tromel,Luxembourg,1st April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,7,March 28 - departure point Luxembourg on LH6861 to Frankfurt continuing from Frankfurt to Dulles Int'l Airport (Virginia USA) on LH418. Other than for the unfortunate strikes which delayed my original flight plan I found the ground personnel and the flight personnel always helpful polite and very professional. I also appreciated having been warned at least 48 hours ahead of time regarding the strike. It gave me enough time to reschedule and change my itinerary. Lufthansa has always been regarded as a stellar airline. It would be regretful to demote its branding due to the strikes.
2121,,L Barron,United States,1st April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Istanbul IST to Munich airport on March 25th at 6.25 am and the flight left on time and arrived early. The flight attendants were very friendly and the airline was very punctual. The return flight from Munich to Istanbul was just as good as well. Would fly Lufthansa again.
2122,,P Frutiger,United States,1st April 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,1,I was supposed to fly LAX-FRA-BLQ on April 2nd. Due to the pilot strike the flight was cancelled. After over one hour on the phone with the representative I was offered a free of charge rebooking for April 4th ironically the 3rd day of a well pre-planned strike. The representative knew less about the strike and the cancelled flights than I did! After that useless option was given I was offered a seat on the 5th which unfortunately by this time was making the entire trip pointless. I asked for a refund LH declined even if they failed to deliver their part of the transaction. Unacceptable I am a 15 years plus Miles and More customer I will now switch to a different airline.
2123,,Hummel-Schmidt Angelika,United States,31st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 429 CLT-MUC on 3/21/14 and LH 428 on 3/30/14. Great and friendly service new and clean airplane seats very tight almost no room for legs (for this price I expected more leg room wouldn't complain if LH was a cheap airline).
2124,,Dirk Toebben,Germany,31st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,My preferred airline to keep my status (SEN). I like the fact that they welcome to you personally aboard as a senator. This was not done on this trip however. The next space in the economy is not all that great but that is probably true for most deadlines. What I do not like about Lufthansa is that they have greatly reduce their miles earnings on certain flights as of this year. If my chances to renew my status were further reduced I would probably look into other airlines more often as well. On this trip I had a nice seat in the exit row. Unfortunately I had a huge guy sitting next to me so it was all cramped in anyway. In addition the baby across the aisle cried the entire night however these are not Lufthansa's fault of course. The flight was on time even 20 minutes early.
2125,,Hoffmann Alexander,Germany,31st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,FRA-HKG in First. Like always an excellent experience from airport to inflight services. 747/8 very comfortable plane with beautiful cabin. Seats comfortable in every position. Staff great and sophisticated as usual. Food good but not top class. Champagne and wine left nothing to desire. Any time again!
2126,,Roger Tyler,United States,30th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,"LH754 FRA-BLR. 747-400. Excellent flight. Clean and comfortable cabin. Delightful service with a crew that actually cared about your level of comfort and needs. Food was way above standard for most mainline airlines. This was a second sector flowing on from a UAL connecting flight. The comparisons are beyond explaining. The UAL plane was a 777-200 ER. It was old dirty and basically a disgrace. The crew were in their old United way ""Perfunctory"". They had a job to do. Do it and get the passengers out of their hair. Hence when I look upon LH it is in direct comparison to the former flight. Where LH lost my vote was in baggage. They went on strike in FRA and my bags took two days to locate. The attempts to get it to me were lacking to say the least."
2127,,M Muser,United States,30th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,1,no,2,"Flight from MUC to ORD Economy Class on Airbus A330 Windows seat at Emergency exit. Check-in online drop luggage at priority counter (Star Alliance Gold) was quick. Boarding on time (first time since a long time) priority boarding crowded but ok. Interior was the ""new"" Economy class with the latest Entertainment system. Seat is more uncomfortable than previous versions. Entertainment system: cannot plug-in headset unless monitor extracted - so not possible to use during take-off and landing (step backwards compared to old system). Selection of entertainment system was ok operation slow audio terrible (not loud enough). Food (pasta pizza) again poor quality. Service less frequent than usual with limited choice. Restrooms not very well maintained. Flight attendants not overly friendly for one this might have been her first flight so she was struggling (which is ok of course for the first time)."
2128,,Andreas Zuschke,Luxembourg,30th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,LH 419 IAD-FRA in Boeing 747-8. The Crew was friendly and the service good. The aircraft was immaculate. I booked a seat with extra legroom at an extra cost of 60€. The seat gave me ample legroom which was nice but it had no recline. Still a good travel experience.
2129,,G Lee,United Kingdom,30th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,5,yes,5,8/3/14 FRA-JNB LH 572 and 23/3/14 JNB-FRA LH573 (equip: A380). On the flight out the aircraft was clean but the seats were very hard and on the flight out the staff had a poor level of English (no manners). The worst part was the new inflight system the touch screen was poor at responding to input on both flights. Regarding food they only had pasta left by the time they had reached us. Highlight of going with Lufthansa was Ground staff. The worked hard in our personal needs. Overall half the price as BA but bring a soft pillow if you want to sleep.
2130,,Mazurkiewicz Adam,Poland,29th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,"LH457. The plane itself was modern with attractive entertainment system. Plenty of room for carry-on baggage improved seats in economy class interesting dim lighting during ""sleep"" time. However Los Angeles airport is missing information for passengers making it very difficult to find the proper terminal and gate even for advanced travelers especially for those who change their travel from domestic flight to the international one."
2131,,Usenovic Nikola,Croatia,28th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,22 Mar 2014 Washington to Frankfurt LH419. I was negatively surprised with very uncomfortable seats in new aircraft (747-800). They look stylish and although there was enough leg room (190cm tall) the seat was hard and not supportive for my back. Not many movies to choose from compared to some other airlines. Other than this everything was good.
2132,,Pelletier Blaise,Switzerland,27th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,"LH 490/491. My flight went smoothly. The crew were friendly and treated us well (for ""coach""). The entertainment system offered plenty of distraction. The food was correct (coach standards) but the choice was poor. On the inbound flight to Seattle we got twice the same choice pasta or chicken. Even if they were prepared and cooked differently it was the same choice. I believe it should be possible to offer a 3rd type of meal (fish or meat). Swiss remains my favorite and first choice however Lufthansa is and will remain my second choice."
2133,,Tobia Sarpellon,Italy,27th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,4,ORD-VCE LH 431 on March 18. Lufthansa Economy class is terrible. Courtesy comfort and service provided should be improved and they should add premium economy.
2134,,C Schmidt,Germany,26th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,0.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,LH431. Seats are terrible - the person behind you only has to touch your seat and it feels like a punch in the back. In addition when the person in front of you decides to use the reclining function it's almost impossible to move or get out of your seat. You have to follow suit in order to have some breathing space. A second glass of wine for dinner would have been nice.
2135,,M Duitsman,United States,26th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,3,no,1,My 9.30 LH309 flight on 23/3/2014 out of Florence Italy was cancelled due to rain. Only one Lufthansa representative was available to rebook the entire flight's customers. After retrieving our luggage waiting in a long line to rebook through your only available representative in Florence we were to board a bus to take us to Bologna leaving at 13.00. It actually left at 14.15. No representative guided us with instructions on which bus to get on. When we arrived in Bologna one Lufthansa representative said to get into Line 35. When we approached the Lufthansa representative at Line 35 she got annoyed that we were in the wrong line. When I pointed out the gentleman who told us to get in her line she grabbed my ticket and approached that man. She came back without my ticket and told us we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the flight. Finally I got out of line and approached the man showed him my passport to get my ticket back. The meal voucher we were given in Florence was not honored in Bologna. Finally we got our baggage checked and seats assigned in Bologna 2 hours before our flight. When we arrived in Frankfurt no representative was there to greet us and walk us to where we were to get hotel vouchers. The whole experience was awful. Stress levels could have been lessened if Lufthansa people were well-informed and actually gave us correct information and were there to actually meet us and show us where or what we had to do. Walking around the airports in Bologna and Frankfurt with luggage on a wild goose chase because Lufthansa representatives didn't have a clue or gave us misdirection's was very bad mismanagement of customers and very poor customer service. I understand they cannot control the weather but Lufthansa CAN control the information given to customers after a cancellation and actually have representatives in place to guide us at each airport.
2136,,Jean Schuetz,Germany,24th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,2,I took a round trip from FRA to LAX for business. During the flight back the cabin was freezing cold. I was sitting in the rear part of the aircraft on the window side. The supplied blankets are completely ineffective because they are made of wide mesh kind of fabric that still lets the cold air pass through that is coming from the overhead ventilation slots. In the end I had to wear my winter jacket all the time. The lady next to me also complained and was sitting there with a thick winter jacket scarf cap and gloves.
2137,,Maximilian Pflaum,Germany,24th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,I flew on the new 747-8 from IAD to FRA. The aircraft was amazingly comfortable and the seats in Economy are definitely an upgrade from previous LH Eco-seats. Service was great and staff very friendly. Only downside is the PTV this is very slow and therefore can be annoying after a while. All in all this was a great experience.
2138,,Jon Popa,United States,24th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH438. Flight and cabin service very good. Attendants very courteous and attentive. Food quality and selection seem to be downgraded from previous flights. Seat too small and uncomfortable (I am a small person). Space between seat in front very tight.
2139,,Jon Popa,United States,24th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,LH439. Flight and Service very good. Food quality and selection not so good. Seats much too small. Seat in front reclined much too far. Had to request passenger in front to adjust the seat forward so that I could eat and even get out of the seat during flight.
2140,,Annegret Borrmann,Germany,24th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Flying from the US I always would prefer a non-US Airline. I have been flying LH for quite some time but service and especially food has deteriorated. Since we prefer Airbus instead of flying Boeing we always used the connection via Munich. Maybe next time we will try either KLM or Air France provided we can chose those airlines both ways. We experienced the US airlines with very low standard: service/food/and seating.
2141,,Tambe Suhas,United States,22nd March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,4,2nd Mar 2014 LH 431 Chicago - Frankfurt. 3rd Mar 2014 LH 760 Frankfurt - Delhi. 17th Mar 2014 LH 761 Delhi - Frankfurt. 17th Mar 2014 LH 430 Frankfurt - Chicago. A pleasant surprise on the flight was the availability of power outlets everywhere. But there were no seats with greater legroom I was ready to pay for. Other things were good as usual including the ever-smiling and helpful cabin crew. One suggestion though. Please stop further cutting corners on food to save costs. The snack pack is so thin already. Finally still waiting to hear about a Special Class between Business and Economy.
2142,,J Singh,United States,22nd March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,2,yes,7,LH from ATL to FRA. Recaro business class seats on the A340 are not full lie flats but are still very comfortable. Dinner was surprisingly delicious and service was efficient yet not intrusive typically German I suppose. Major negative was the IFE screen which were small and washed out better to use my mobile phone than waste time with this relic from the 90's.
2143,,V Donnelly,Ireland,21st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,,,3,yes,4,Even with high class tickets very poor mileage accrual in comparison to competing airlines. A340 new aircraft seats recline too much. Makes it impossible to work on laptop or exit your seat without asking the person in front to please go forward. This makes the flight terribly uncomfortable. Food is really quite poor. However I fly a lot with LH and the staff are always lovely. No shortage of beverages and smiles. Wide network and travel through good hubs. The lounges can vary some good some not so good. Overall if they stopped putting such a recline on seats and matched competitors on mileage gain it would be a lot better.
2144,,M Wagner,Austria,21st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,LH 424 from Munich to Boston. Ground service good and fast Business lounge in Munich (with frequent flyer status) good but pretty packed. A330 in 2x4x2 Economy configuration and plane was packed to nearly the last seat. Despite this the cabin crew got 5 rounds of drink-service done after the main meal impressive and efficient. They were also very attentive and friendly. A negative point for Lufthansa's extreme cost cutting program as on both meals no choice available always only a single meal available which feels poor for an Airline with a claim of being a premium carrier.
2145,,K Ludewig,Germany,21st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,13/3/2014 LH 490. Nice and comfortable flight from Frankfurt to Seattle with a 3 seat row for myself.
2146,,Rainer Macherey,Germany,21st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,7,LH430 FRA-ORD on March 15th. Flynet was again not working. Toilets were awful after a few hours. Service personnel were very friendly. Water was dripping out of the A/C overhead after takeoff and before landing.
2147,,R Moessner,Germany,21st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,ORD-MUC: Flight left on time staff nice as always. Food could be better. Beverage Service and hot towels are just good. Overall good experience for a pretty good Price. Would do it again.
2148,,A Kearney,United Kingdom,21st March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,,,5,yes,10,LH2482 MUC-LHR. First time flying with Lufthansa and very impressed. Flight was on time cabin crew attentive and good inflight service (bar service tea/coffee and tasty sandwiches provided) - significantly better than that offered on most short haul European flights. Would definitely use again.
2149,,A Kusnierczak,Thailand,18th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,Bangkok - Kuala Lumpur onboard Boeing 747-400. Flight was very nice comfortable and on time. Lufthansa should consider improving their IFE which works very slowly. It would be nice to receive more than just one sandwich. The was flight was nice comfortable and price was very affordable.
2150,,Kraebber Sharon,United States,18th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,First rate flight New 747-8 from Chicago to Frankfurt roomy seats even in Economy. Food quantity and quality has decreased. Beverage and hot towels service still rates high!
2151,,M Montagna,Italy,18th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,5,Flight LH457 LAX-FRA First class. First class is a luxury. However some problems on the ground: The attendant at LAX lounge forgot to collect all the passengers when the flight was announced. Considering that the flight took off with a 1.5 hr delay and the transit time was 1h 45mins I expected some info from the cabin personnel about the feasibility to catch the next flight but nobody was able to give me an answer even though the question was put to them several times. I thought there would be somebody to meet me at the exit to bring me to the next flight nobody was there.
2152,,Anistratenko Oxana,Russian Federation,18th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,8,Feb 22 LH 2531 LH 452. March 8 UA 1207 LH 431. March 9 LH 1444. I've been using this airline for almost 10 years now both for flights within Europe and for Transcontinental ones. I'm generally happy with the service the food is always good even in the economy class. Flight attendants are generally very nice and often seem to be happy with what they're doing.
2153,,C McAndrew,United Kingdom,17th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,yes,4,LH575 from Cape Town to Munich on Monday 10th March. Disappointed with overall service provided compared to price paid. Poor inflight entertainment drinks offered were few and far between and meals average at best.
2154,,Dimitrios Simeonidis,Greece,17th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,SKG-MUC A3 500. MUC-JFK LH 410. JFK-MUC LH 411. MUC-SKG A3 501. Lufthansa is the airline that me and my family members have been using in the last 20 years. I have been a member of the Senator Club as well. We prefer LH for obvious reasons such as security good service in air and on the ground kind and experienced personnel. Fleet with new and well maintained airplanes. In short Lufthansa satisfies most if not all requirements of most passengers.
2155,,Shiva Prasad,India,17th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Travelled to India from Orlando (MCM) via Frankfurt on Feb 23 2014. It was a great experience. The front desk supervisors on that day helped me a lot and the flight attendants were good onboard. Overall it was a very pleasant journey.
2156,,Stefan Johansson,Denmark,17th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,yes,8,LH415 IAD-MUC. It's generally good. Food and leg space in economy is ok. What I didn't like this time was that they started to serve dinner at 23.40! We departed at 22.55.At that hour it should be dark and silent.
2157,,Marlies Leist,Germany,17th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,5,LH 429 CLT-MUC. Everybody was very friendly the only thing I did not like: I had a reservation for 2 seats (window/aisle) since last June. The day we took our flights (March 11th) we learned that our seats did not exist anymore and that we had new seats in the middle of a row of four! As we protested we got two new seats in the back of the airplane at least two seats on the aisle. Why did nobody tell us as soon as the reserved seats were not available anymore? I think Lufthansa should not treat customers like that.
2158,,Michael Kasberg,Germany,13th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,FRA-BKK v.v. First fully booked on both flights so the service was a bit slow. A340-600 with old seats but comfortable enough for a good sleep. F&B excellent with caviar service and outstanding wines. IFE with not many options small TV screen. Two FA's very friendly but for 8 pax LH should deploy more staff. All flights on time overall good value for money. But I found out shortly that LH will not offer F to BKK any longer from summer onwards.
2159,,M Tushishvili,France,11th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,The flight from Paris to Tbilisi via Munich. Both flights were just excellent. Very efficient check-in and boarding in Paris. Both aircraft's were very clean with informative updates from the pilot. Seats are actually very comfortable in comparison with low cost airlines. Paris-Tbilisi route offers excellent hot food (I had very tasty chicken) as well as the full bar service. One important fact which is important to highlight. I had short connection (45 minutes) in Munich and the plane departed half hour late from Paris. I thought that I would miss the plane to Tbilisi and the big surprise was that the ground staff was waiting for me and transferred from the plane to plane. This is excellent service and deep appreciation to Munich airport and Lufthansa ground staff!
2160,,Jon Pirtle,United States,11th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Departure from Charlotte to MUC-VIE: 10 Dec 2013 on LH 428. Return from Vienna to Charlotte via MUC: 6 March 2014 on LH 429. I travel regularly between the USA and Europe and I choose Lufthansa every time if it is available. The airline is reliable and consistent. Their staff both on-board and on the ground are considerate and helpful.
2161,,Martin Zitz,Germany,11th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Feb 23 LH412. Feb 28 LH429. Generally good service good planes well operated - Miles & More starts to become an issue. No general rewards hard to achieve status service drastically declines without status.
2162,,M Proppe,Poland,11th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,LH491 on 3 March. Very professional safe punctual and helpful. The Service on board was very good as always. I was very happy to be able to use FlyNet and send all my work to my office while travelling. Also connection time was very convenient allowing us time to refresh in FRA after intercontinental flight.
2163,,J Ackermann,Germany,10th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,FRA-EZE/EZE-FRA. Flights on time staff pleasant. Old Business Class: seats a nightmare IFE problems on both flights FlyNet not working on any leg food appalling. No taking of orders. You get your courses from the food cart which stores loads of plates under aluminium foil lids. My companion got a VLML special meal main course on return flight: pasta with tomato sauce and cheese! Cheese stuck to the lid and was transferred on the pasta using a cocktail stirrer. Dessert: five slices of fruit served together with main course. White wine out of stock after starters. Service uncoordinated. It was a disgrace and I was ashamed for our German flag carrier.
2164,,Barnicoat Graham,Germany,10th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Flight LH419 Dulles Intl - Frankfurt Intl 25/3/2014. As I am part of the Miles & More programme I prefer to fly Lufthansa. On my last flight I was looked after well the flight left on time and landed early and I was able to choose a seat with extra leg room which is important for me.
2165,,J Ackermann,Germany,10th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,TXL-FRA/FRA-TXL. Both flights on time nice staff high quality food which was nicely presented. LH's domestic business product is far better that the long-haul one. Flaws: no Wifi and IFE whatsoever.
2166,,Wylezol Roman,Poland,7th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,LH435 ORD-FRA. Very comfortable the highest standard of services on board. On time despite the snowy weather in Chicago. There was only one issue - prior to LH flight I flew from SLC to ORD (LH codeshare operated by United Airlines) - the worst quality I have experienced.
2167,,S Molling,United States,7th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,9,LH428 on 3/5/14. Great crew good meals provided as well as in-flight entertainment. The only thing I would add is that it would be extremely convenient to be able to pay for additional baggage on-line like other airlines do.
2168,,Gruendel Mike,Germany,7th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2,no,2,LH 411 2 March. My seat was in the first row on the aisle. Due to the service it was not possible to stretch my legs for a long period of time. After the flight I still had pain in my back. The onboard service was not very satisfying and the meal served was not really edible.
2169,,C Barkei,Luxembourg,6th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,,,3,yes,7,3 flights with Lufthansa inside Europe. All on time and reliable. Seat in Economy is quite firm but OK for a short period of time. I got bored of the sandwich after the first one but then got the identical one twice more so I gave it away. Staff were friendly and the coffee was good. The Senator lounge in Munich was excellent as were the lounges in Manchester and Luxembourg. No in-flight entertainment so bring a book or read the paper. A very solid product.
2170,,Max Primorac,United States,5th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Arriving to Washington DC Dulles Airport for my flight to Croatia via Frankfurt Airport I was offered special care due to a lower back injury that severely hampered my physical movement. From the US through Frankfurt Airport and upon arrival in Zagreb Croatia I was offered friendly transit support at each and every stage. I have made this flight over 100 times and despite the pain associated with my injury I must say that this was the most satisfying travel experience I have had in over 30 years of international travel.
2171,,Adam Wang,United Kingdom,4th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,"LHR-MUN-PEK-FRA-LCY. My 5th London - Beijing flights with Lufthansa within 2 years and I have to say the quality is stable and consistent as well as good value for money. For both the outbound and inbound paths the flights are on time if not slightly early during the long haul flight several water runs during the night and the staff are the biggest assets providing the friendly efficient and professional services. During the flight between PEK and FRA the new Boeing 747-800 was used it offered the personal power socket and free WIFI onboard which is extremely good value. The only slight drawback is that you can not select seats on the exit rows online and airport check in as they are ""occupied"" however when on board you realised that half of them are empty."
2172,,M Krafft,Germany,4th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,LH 419 departure on Feb 27 2014. I flew with Lufthansa's new 747-8i. Nice clean and very new plane. I was seated in the main cabin in row 16 (first row in coach class). For an overnight flight it is recommendable to aim for a exit row seat since you cannot stretch your legs and the arm rests are firm. The meals and beverages/drinks provided were all very good and did meet my expectations. Getting on and off the plane was fast and efficient. All in all still a satisfactory experience.
2173,,Arnold Sebastian,Germany,4th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,7,LH464 from Frankfurt to Orlando in Business Class with our infant (12 weeks old). Check-in in Frankfurt for family's was very good due to extra check-in counter. Service onboard and the food was ok. Nice wine collection and space for my legs.
2174,,S Redfern,United Kingdom,4th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,Flew return GIG-Tegel via Frankfurt. Check-in in Rio was a bit of a nightmare. A massive queue with no priority until got closer the desk. Took me over half an hour. Lounge in Rio did not have many options of drinks/food. The plane was an old A340 but it was well kept and the crew was very attentive. Food ok. Angled flat seats which are not very comfortable. Return leg was much different. Lounge in FRA quite good priority check in old A340 but excellent service and food.
2175,,J Menard,Canada,4th March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,Lufthansa flight 493 from Vancouver to Frankfurt on March 2nd 2014: I was impressed with Lufthansa's service in coach class. Tasty meals and a great variety of free beverages and snacks offered throughout the flight. Cabin staff was very cheerful and approaching even though it was a full flight with some quite challenging passengers around me.
2176,,A Yong,United Kingdom,3rd March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,3,yes,7,SIN-FRA-BHX in Economy. First leg from Singapore on the A380 was great largely because I was fortunate enough to get an exit row seat with unlimited legroom (judging by fellow passengers one wouldn't be happy with normal seats as they had rather pathetic legroom). Nice modern AVOD system but the PTVs were rather small compared to other A380 airlines. Service was really friendly and warm but few frills (no amenity kit whatsoever no footrests). Meals were alright but again rather simple compared to Asian carriers. Second leg to Birmingham on an A320 was above average by intra-Europe standards with a decent snack/beverage service and friendly service again. All flights on time.
2177,,Vukmanovic Goran,Switzerland,3rd March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,"Flights LH720 and LH721 from FRA to PEK and back. Everything written regarding the Lufthansa business class seats is absolutely true. Outbound flight on new 747-8 with new business class seats which are flat beds. Unfortunately if you are satt near the window in flat bad position it is almost impossible to get out of the ""bed"" without disturbing your co-passenger. On top your feet are very squeezed in the tiny hole at the bottom of the bed. Food choice OK as well as beverages. IFE system I would rate as average. Flight on time. Inbound flight - nightmare instead of 747-8 it was old 747-4. As I checked in online nobody at the counter mentioned that the plane was changed and consequently my seat. Departure late for more than an hour. Old business class seats which are a disaster if you have the idea to sleep during the flight (not flat bed and very uncomfortable). Entertainment system was not working for more than two hours of the flight as needed to be reset. Food on the same level as outbound flight. No soap in the toilette. At the end arrived on time to catch my connecting flight. Overall will use them only if I have to otherwise for the same or lower cost other ME airlines and even the airlines from the Lufthansa group are offering much more for the same buck."
2178,,Alexander Kunzle,Switzerland,3rd March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,4,no,7,LH457 LAX-FRA 26/2/2014. Service OK seats in new 747/8 are very bad with not enough space! Food was good beverage service not satisfying!
2179,,Andreas Dietzel,Germany,3rd March 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,7,The LH 411 flight from JFK to Munich was in total a very comfortable one. The service was much better than expected.
2180,,Herman Mitzi,Germany,28th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,Flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Great value for money. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment could be improved for instance a more modern and larger movie selection as on other competing airlines. Considering that the flight was 180 Euros cheaper than Singapore Airlines I was very satisfied.
2181,,Carl Randem,Norway,26th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH456 FRA-LAX 21 Feb 14. Great trip with LH new aircraft nice and enjoyable/humoristic crew. Nothing to say on the service although the seats do need an upgrade it does not contribute to the full experience as the entire flight overall is good. The entertainment system (AVOD) is easy to use although late responding but with a good selection of films music and travel information. Overall a very nice experience and flight.
2182,,Claus Roth,United States,25th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,2,yes,7,LH 428 on Feb 16 2014 from MUC to CLT. Flew First Class - very attentive friendly service. Insufficient movie selection in comparison to other airlines. Entertainment system often malfunctioning so in this case no service call or reading light activation possible.
2183,,T Naver,Switzerland,25th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,3,no,6,Disappointed with the recent Buenos Aires to Frankfurt flight. Several crew members seemed rude and unmotivated when an elderly lady boarded with a light and small suitcase the flight attendant refused to help her stow it away. Other occasions the crew were not helpful: to a family travelling with small children removing food plates instead they walked over it and complained about it. Other than that service was been ok flight attendants served passengers with water and juice several times during the night in addition to the self-service bar area with small snacks and beverages. Dinner was ok breakfast was very disappointing. Unfortunately there are not many alternatives on this route. However on the outbound journey the crew both on ground and on board were much nicer and all flights were on time.
2184,,Lars Bjoerner,Germany,25th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,EWR-MUC 19/02/2013 LH413. My travel experience was great. From check-in to lounge and boarding it was very smooth and easy. The flight itself was relaxing food and drink was excellent and the staff very friendly. In the end we were even 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I wish flying would always be like this experience.
2185,,Philip van wegen-wirth,Germany,25th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,8,"LH410. Not having much space these day in normal economy class with 6'6'"" height it is nice to know that is still possible to get the emergency exits. Service is good and very friendly."
2186,,Juraj Kovac,Czech Republic,24th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,9,Early-morning feeder flights from to Frankfurt and back outbound on a brand new A320 return on an older plane with newish cabin. The core product is rather basic both in terms of comfort and services but the planes were spotless the crews extremely professional and the slimline seats at least provide decent legroom. LH still serves nice breakfast and drinks even on these short hops and there is really nothing major to complain about. One thing to improve is seat assignment in economy which tends to get really messy at times.
2187,,J Gensert,Germany,21st February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,6,Unfortunately we were unable to use the online check-in service on the Lufthansa homepage. This service is apparently unavailable when you have a connecting flight in Los Angeles (LAX to FRA) and come from the Big Island of Hawaii - Kona Airport for that matter - meaning that our 4 tickets were scattered all over the plane. Luckily this problem could easily be solved by a friendly member of the Lufthansa ground staff in LA. The flight from LA to Frankfurt was okay overall seats on the 747-8I are not the most uncomfortable though a little too lightly padded. Dinner and Breakfast were offered - both were quite good. The inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies in various languages (sadly variety was not that great) the flight attendant were generally nice. We would recommend Lufthansa.
2188,,A Davidson,Canada,20th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Feb 18 2014: Lufthansa - LH1817 - Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC). This segment was part of a five flight itinerary with United Airlines a review of which can be found under their name. This particular Lufthansa experience was as always superbly efficient on the ground in both Barcelona and Munich. Navigating airports at either end was a breeze and the embarkation and disembarkation process easy and smooth. The flight itself had both an on-time departure and arrival and the in-flight service was as expected superb and efficient as one would expect from Lufthansa. Always a treat to fly with Lufthansa and will continue to do so whenever possible.
2189,,P Spangenberg,Germany,20th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 410 MUC to JFK 1st Feb 2014. The flight was fully booked but it was ok. Crew very friendly. Since I was sitting at rear I had only one meal left to choose. The space for my feet was very limited because of some mounted housings under the seat in front. Too little space to place something like a bottle of water and a book. Plane was new and in good shape.
2190,,Stella Nuti,Italy,18th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,8,Flight 457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt was delayed due a technical problem. Unfortunately there was no assistance for me at the arrival gate since my flight connection was half an hour later I had to rush pass again through the security check and immigration. I arrived breathless at the gate of my flight to Florence where we were told that they had to change the aircraft due to a technical problem. I had to wait for another hour. Concerning the service on board and the aircraft (a new B747-800) I have nothing to complain about.
2191,,Douitsis Athanasios,Greece,18th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,3,yes,9,LH431 from ORD to FRA. These long haul flights now have wifi which was a pleasant surprise. Apart from that the cabin was not particularly full which made it easy to put the bag under the seat next to me etc. I suspect the comfort would be diminished if it was otherwise. Apart from that no other surprises the food was good the staff polite the flight was on schedule.
2192,,Saketh Rahm,United States,17th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,,2,no,3,ORD-FRA-DEL. A typical mixed bag of service. ORD-FRA was supposed to be on 747-8 and I booked this flight specifically for this aircraft but they downgraded to normal 747 in the last minute. This caused chaos in ORD as they were short 16 business class seats all passengers had to be reassigned their seats which caused my family to be split up and in middle seats - at several thousand dollars each we were not happy. Crew tried their best but no one would move and we were seated all over the cabin. Food was mediocre at best on this route and angled seats did not provide for great sleeping. Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines. Arrival at DEL was a mess with business and first class bags off-loaded last which annoyed premium paying passengers. Only highlight really was LH Senator Lounge in FRA which was very nice. For the price paid I would try another carrier.
2193,,N Barraci,Germany,14th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,LH418 FRA-IAD 8 Feb. It was a rather comfortable flight in a not too fully booked Economy Class cabin. My major issue with this flight was about the internet connectivity on board. Unfortunately again FlyNet did not work at all. It has become a rather unreliable service over the last few months. Seating comfort on the new 747-8 is rather good nevertheless when someone sits next to you in Economy it is really a challenge to survive a long-haul flight. The distance to the front seat could be improved but most likely will not. Again I have to point out that as a Lufthansa status customer (Frequent Traveller Star Alliance Silver) I am being treated better by United (complimentary upgrade to Economy plus priority boarding priority luggage) than by Lufthansa.
2194,,Bart De Maertelaere,Belgium,14th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,LH418 Feb 9 2014. As a frequent flyer (and holding Senator status with the Star Alliance) I prefer to fly with Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners as they offer me the best routes to get me to my destination. On every flight I experienced good service the crew handled any extra requests with a smile.
2195,,T Bathory,United States,13th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,LH 429 Jan 31 2014 CLT to MUC. LH 428 Feb 8 2014 MUC-CLT. The service is excellent the crew polite and nice. No significant delays. Food is reasonably good for airline food. We certainly wouldn't choose a different airline to cross the Atlantic.
2196,,Matias Sosoi,Finland,12th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,5,yes,9,I flew from Philadelphia to Frankfurt. Plane was old Airbus A340-300 interior being in clean and good shape. Business having own check-in was nice staff being polite except supervisor having an argument with a customer at next counter. Almost better than real TV. For Business Class passengers there was own boarding lane. At Cabin boarding drink with choices were offered. Business class has lie flat seats but not latest fully flat yet. According to my knowledge Lufthansa is installing new fully flats on their fleet. During flight the service was nice first with cocktail and snacks. 15min later came food service with appetizers with choices. From three warm choices you can choose your main course. Wines were good and I slept rest of the flight comfortably and missed breakfast service.
2197,,A Barlow,United States,11th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,LH 435 ORD-MUC 2/6/2014-2/7/2014. Good flight. I was lucky that the seat next to me was empty so I had more space. Otherwise the seat would have been really small. Service staff friendliness punctuality were all better than on previous flights with other airlines.
2198,,Bernhard Otten,Germany,7th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,5,no,2,LH 457 from LA to Frankfurt Boeing 747 - Seat 35H: There was no space for my feet under the seat because there was a metal box under the seat in front of 35H. For a long distance trip this is not acceptable!
2199,,Schubert Stefan,Germany,5th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,LH 435 Chicago - Munich. January 30 2014. Nothing to complain about flight was on time on board service in general was good however the only point I can complain about is that breakfast could have been better. I suspect that the reason for the quality of breakfast below what one could be expect from Lufthansa is that on flights from the US to Europe catering is done by a US company hence the quality of bread is quite poor.
2200,,H Puneck,Germany,5th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,"Frankfurt-Abu Dhabi-Frankfurt booked a special for 429 Euro in September flew in January - a 6 day trip. Excellent value for money. New A330 cabin with improved seats in economy class and brand new wireless inflight entertainment system which means no more entertainment box under the seats and therefore more legroom. System with good responsiveness high definition and you can even use your own headphones (""one plug""-system). Flight information system with satellite views is great! WIFI on board for extra cost available on most time of the flight. Staff service as always on Lufthansa efficient friendly correct and professional. Meals decent (1 hot meal 1 sandwich service) wide range of free (even alcoholic) drinks friendly welcome in the galley for more drinks. Hot towel service is always welcome. Only organization of boarding in Abu Dhabi should be improved too narrow waiting lounge for two flights at the same time. Both flights ahead of schedule."
2201,,Jeremy Appleton,Italy,4th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,no,1,As a very regular customer of Lufthansa I am normally a fan and very happy with the service they offer and provide. Unfortunately my last flight: Frankfurt/Los Angeles (LH 456) was an exception. Having been offered a complimentary upgrade to Business Class at the gate I was then downgraded on board back to Economy with minimal apology nor effort to find a suitable alternative. (I understood the issue as the Business Class seat had in fact been sold to a passenger on Business Class standby but given my status and the value of business I give LH every year it was disappointing). On this occasion the situation was made worse by a particularly difficult neighbor and some average service on board. As I said not a normal experience with Lufthansa but frustrating all the same.
2202,,Enrique Simeone,Belgium,4th February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,1st class on FRA-EZE-FRA Boeing 747-400 with only 8 seats which are a rather good option - chair plus bed aside. Service is good but not excellent. Choice of and beverages is just ok. Have travelled them before a few times with this configuration and it is to my liking although not a suite is as good as! Skilled staff but oldie planes. Check in disastrous on all occasions lounge in FRA splendid in EZE and Sao a disaster! Not as good as flying Swiss international.
2203,,T Powell,Spain,3rd February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,9,Sao Paulo to Frankfurt and on to Madrid. Checked in for my flights and was treated in a courteous and friendly manner. Chaos at Guarulhos due to the construction work ahead of the World Cup. Our gate remained occupied by a TAP A340 with a delayed departure leading to being bussed to our 747 parked at a remote stand. Pushed back from the stand about 1.5 hours late and waited in a long line for take-off. Nice reception on-board and seated in a center aisle with the middle seat free. The service was excellent and the food of a decent quality with the usual drinks and wine of your choice. I have to say that I find the LH business class seat lacking in comfort and as it doesn't go flat is quite hard to find a comfortable sleeping position. It is time for a revamp of that seat. The entertainment selection is good and I particularly like one of the radio channels. Headsets are decent but not up to the Bose quality used by other carriers. This is an 11 hour flight so plenty of time to relax. Breakfast was good and I find the cabin crew to be of a consistently high standard. Fix that seat and this is a very competitive product.
2204,,Meirsschaert Pascal,Belgium,3rd February 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,I took the flight to Orlando from Frankfurt and back from Charleston to Munich. Sufficient space in Economy. There could be some better variation in food selection. Free drinks is much appreciated. Inflight entertainment could do with a wider selection of recent movies.
2205,,Zinsser Werner,Germany,31st January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,4,LH457. Departure and arrival on time. Confusing boarding practise in Los Angeles. Narrow seats not comfortable. Meals on board OK. Service average - recommendation only if LH is less expensive than competitors (Singapore Airlines / Emirates).
2206,,Joachim Schorr,Germany,31st January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,26/1/2014 LH 438 Frankfurt - Dallas. Very dedicated service and personnel when the cabin is not full service becomes slow when Fist Class is fully booked as there only is one person serving. Great Food and wine section and good media service. Still too many planes around which have the old setting in place not on the last trip which was great.
2207,,Matthias Beuge,Germany,31st January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,7,Boston to Munich LH425. Reliable friendly in-flight and check-in staff. Poor SMS system for flight updates. One SMS informs customers that the flight is late another one about 1.5 hours later told customers the flight will be on time. When arriving at the airport it was late again. They are still doing averagely when it comes to pampering of their top status customers. There is hardly ever a complimentary upgrade while my US colleagues on US carriers get upgraded 75% of the time on long haul flights.
2208,,F Luigi,Italy,29th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,LH429 CLT-MUC A330: Flight very cold but service food and beverages ok. New Policy for Miles a little bit complex for economy class: too many classes and you can't select the right one when you book a flight.
2209,,Tasselli Valerio,Italy,29th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,LH419 January 23. Washington to Frankfurt. Plane was half empty so it was a very smooth and quiet ride. Always pretty satisfied with the efficiency of Lufthansa although they could improve the quality and seating space.
2210,,S Brandt,Germany,28th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Flight Abu Dhabi-Frankfurt: new business class seats on this night flight an absolute improvement compared to the old seat that is still in use. Wish all Lufthansa long haul seats in this class were already installed! Service on board really friendly and chatty. Nice snack and aperitif after departure good breakfast 1 hour prior to arrival. Could have been served 15 mins earlier but at the same time crew allowed us to sleep longer. Inflight entertainment improved as well a lot. The map/route should have music in the background. The new seat is perfect to sleep completely flat. Amenity kit is a plus. Smooth flight and professional service. A330 10 years old but in perfect condition. Welcome lounge in Frankfurt a nice place to have a shower and another great breakfast after this night flight.
2211,,H Mutschler,Germany,28th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,3,yes,7,Flew CGN-MUC on a Saturday. Onward flight was nearly empty so you could seat any seat. Two drinks one coffee and one apple juice on a nice Airbus 321. Return flight on the same day was packed so all bins where overloaded. It took ages to board. Got drinks as well crew did a good job for a 55 minutes flight.
2212,,Keller Christoph,Germany,28th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,2,yes,2,I travelled flight LH456 on Saturday 18th January from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. It was extremely cold on this plane due to some problems with the air-conditioning (seat 33H). Other passengers seated in rows in front of me were complaining as it was too hot on their seats! This must be a major problem and to be honest I was very dissatisfied with this situation. The flight attendants did a great job.
2213,,H Schumacher,Germany,28th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,,4,yes,7,I fly Lufthansa a lot long distance. Overall a very solid impression mostly on time friendly and competent staff. Quality of meals has decreased in economy as has seat comfort but that is normal these days. Major complaint on LH456 (FRA-LAX) on a 747-8: The touch screen user experience was ridiculous some input takes 10-20 s to be processed. Not only the case in my seat but pretty much everyone I observed had this problem.
2214,,Kim Krister,Finland,28th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no,2,HEL-MUC/FRA-MAD return. I don't like their new loyalty program downgrade. I booked quite high priced booking class ticket last year hoping to earn more miles and to renew my Frequent Flyer status and loyalty with them just to be faced with the fact that earning miles is now 25% - 50% from mileage flown unless you pay full Y or C priced ticket. 23hrs check in before flight is useless 3 of my 4 flights were of change of equipment and I was automatically moved from reserved first Y row seat to the last rows of the bus. Very inconvenient as I had to wait a long time to get deplaned. Their onboard product has downgraded with NEK seat. 2 x 2hr 20min flight segments resulted me back muscle pain. Seat is so thin and narrow making noises when moving on it it is the most uncomfortable way to travel. Their refreshment offering is okay but snacks are inedible - no healthy and fresh options anymore. Cabin crew did their best service was professional with smiles. Lounge access was good as layovers were 3hrs 30min too long. Loyalty for this airline is completely useless for me I will change my loyalty to another Scandinavian carrier with better timetables.
2215,,Wilhelm Diemo,Germany,25th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3,yes,6,LH430 FRA-ORD Jan 20 2014 New 747-8. Seat comfort is inferior to most other airlines on this segment. Loyalty customer treatment (especially in regards to complimentary upgrades) is unacceptable seems non-existent all the way up to Senator (incl.) and might become real only with HON which is super exclusive. Food quality is average and staff attention in economy is also just average. Staff attention visibly improves from business class onwards. Inflight entertainment is a bad joke especially in economy as well as in any 'old' business or first class seat. Tiny monitors that are often defective. Fairly small movie selection. This is way behind the other airlines that LH wants to compete with. Economy seats in the new 747-8 are ok but seat comfort in the first economy aisle seat right behind business class is impacted by staff continuously pushing the blinds against the passengers legs.
2216,,Lange Michael,Germany,22nd January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,,4,yes,10,Flight DUS-MUC in the evening. Short flight from DUS to MUC. Friendly staff free Drinks (water tea coffee wine bear soft drinks) and savory snacks. We left on time and reached MUC about 20 min early.
2217,,Th Echter,Germany,22nd January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3,yes,8,Frankfurt - Rio de Janeiro - Frankfurt with Lufthansa on A340. On time smooth decent hassle free and without any problems. Extremely friendly professional and attentive crew on both flights. Cocktails served after take off really nice dinner. Large movie selection on personal screens. 2-4-2 seats making it easier for a couple to sit together. Absolutely nothing to complain if there was not the seat itself: Narrow uncomfortable and one of the worst of all my flights. Unfortunately different from other airlines economy seats.
2218,,Gabriels Bart,Belgium,22nd January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH428. Positives: Smooth trip to U.S. Good service nice entertainment program nice food and drinks. To improve: Seat was in the last row of the plane and I didn't had so much space for my legs.
2219,,D Chakarov,Sweden,22nd January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,5,LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. The flight went smoothly and on time (arriving ahead of schedule). No complaints about the flight conditions and service except the performance of the information/entertainment system. The touch screen was not responding thus making the use impossible. I see two main problems - the system is outdated and not properly serviced. However this was a smaller problem for me compared with the failure of the promised Wi-Fi connection.
2220,,Miczinski Lars,Germany,22nd January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,4,Frankfurt (FRA) to Washington Dulles (IAD) LH 418 on December 9 2013. Space comfort in economy class is not great there should be more space! The entertainment program quality was not great it appears to me that mainly only old films are shown in economy class not quite sure if this has something to do with cost savings. I don't understand the beverage concept of Lufthansa I wish there was more non alcoholic beer on board.
2221,,Eigel Herbert,Austria,21st January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,The flight (LH431) was as expected good. The chosen seat was good for my long legs. Departure and Arrival was nearly on time. Only the served breakfast was very poor.
2222,,S Madiwal,Canada,21st January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,6,It's always a pleasure flying with Lufthansa. The flight LH 490 was ready on time for departure and the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile. The aircraft was new and cleanliness in the cabin was satisfactory. This time there was no aerobridge and the boarding was via bus. This added to a bit of inconvenience to some passengers. The new Airbus cabin storage is comparatively small and passengers had to struggle finding a place to put their carry on luggage. Overall the food and beverages selection was good. I would highly recommend this flight to my family and friends.
2223,,Claudio Cappello,Italy,20th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5,yes,10,Flight LH430 was perfect. New Business class seats are really good and comfortable. I've received the upgrade from the economy with no additional costs. Entertainment was ok but sleep on the plane was better and the traveler kit was very helpful. I'll do it again.
2224,,A Kreyssig,United States,17th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,Dec 21 2013 LH431 ORD-FRA. Efficient and friendly service. The new 747-8 aircraft offers a modern ambience in the Economy class LH standard seats with individual now well-functioned entertainment system but still the usual limited space.
2225,,M Studzinski,Poland,16th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,London LHR - Frankfurt. Quick 1 hour flight. Friendly enthusiastic and chatty crew sandwiches offered and full bar service incl. German sparkling wine and bottled beer even in Economy. All on time perfect.
2226,,Stuettgen Johannes,Germany,16th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,,4,yes,9,ORD-MUC LH 435 Jan 11th. Great Service Food is ok but the inflight entertainment system is pretty bad. Movie selection is rather small and the touchscreen is so unresponsive its a pain to navigate the menu.
2227,,D Eickhoelter,Germany,16th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,8,LH 415 Washington-Munich. 10/11 Jan 2014. Overall very good. Friendly service. Good (new) business class seats. I was surprised that I did not get entry to the Star Alliance Lounge at Washington airport even though I had a business class ticket and being FTL silver.
2228,,G Howman,Qatar,16th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,,,4,yes,8,DOH-FRA-YVR: Both legs of flight on A340 aircraft. Not my optimum choice of long-haul platform; however Lufthansa really made the best of things. Traveled economy both legs yet found that both seat space and leg room were more than adequate. Food was so-so and selection of movies average. However cabin crew were very attentive and customer oriented. This airline is becoming my airline of choice.
2229,,S Khezzar,Germany,14th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,5,yes,8,FRA to ORD. I slept most of the time on board so there was not much I had to complain about. Flight attendants very nice and friendly. Boarding in FRA is always very chaotic. It is much better organized in ORD. LH should handle the boarding procedure for FRA like they do it in ORD. I'd recommend that Lufthansa would send an e-mail notification when the plane changes so that passengers who book early can make sure that they can keep their reserved seat.
2230,,Eric Heilmann,Denmark,14th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,Frankfurt to Washington Dulles on Jan 8 flight LH418. Return on Jan 10th flight LH419. I have been flying Lufthansa for many years now both professionally and privately. It is not a cheap airline but I admit that I still use it for my private trips because of the impeccable quality of service at all levels. As a Senator passenger I know I get more perks but I see all the time the genuine attention that the staff puts in when dealing with every passenger. After having delt for many years with numerous american airlines I find this very refreshing!
2231,,Ruediger Beyer,Switzerland,13th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5,yes,9,Flight 490 from Frankfurt / Germany to Seattle / WA on January 6 2014. Very punctual smooth flight. On board service very good. Temperature in plane too low. Entertainment programme and internet service excellent. Digital flight information very good. Meal service fine except for oversight to remove moist cloth and empty cups/cans before serving dinner. Overall impression very good.
2232,,M Tushishvili,France,13th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,30 December 2013 Paris to Tbilisi via Munich LH2237 and LH2556. 8 January 2014 Tbilisi to Paris via Munich LH2557 and LH2230. Check-in was easy and pleasant with brilliant ground staff in Tbilisi. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working especially on the MUC-TBS leg on 30 December. Hot food was served in MUC-TBS-MUC segments and it was very tasty both times. Lufthansa and Turkish are recommended airlines for travelers to Tbilisi.
2233,,Lloyd Michael,United Kingdom,13th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,Manchester UK to Munich LH 2501. Munich to Chicago LH434. I travel with Lufthansa regularly from Great Britain to USA in either Business or First Class. The overall service is always excellent. I can fly directly to the USA from Manchester (UK) but the standard and service of the US Airlines is way below that offered by Lufthansa. Meals are always excellent seating extremely comfortable and cabin staff courteous and helpful. Travelling via Germany adds to my journey time but I find it well worthwhile. Additionally the standard of Lufthansa Lounges are far superior to US Airline ones.
2234,,Duzzi Riccardo,Italy,10th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,,,4,yes,8,VCE-FRA-AMS on 28 December 2013 and then AMS-FRA-VCE on 3 January 2014. Flights were all nice and all on time on comfortable A321 and A319. It didn't make sense that they gave us food on 16:35 pm flight to AMS and not on 12:45 pm flight to FRA but this is just an insignificant detail. Staff was good and smiling and flight experience was good too. I recommend Lufthansa.
2235,,Ana Vetere Arellano,Italy,9th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,8,LH457: I was quite satisfied with this flight. Stewards and stewardesses were friendly food was of good quality and entertainment offered was very good. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed the cartoons. I would suggest that if seats are available travellers with children could be positioned in the plane so that they can be given an extra seat so the child can sleep better. Of course if the flight is full I understand that this is not at all feasible.
2236,,R Jonquieres,United States,9th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5,yes,10,"Flight LH434 from Munich to Chicago was a real pleasure. Smooth ride and super crew - friendly and professional. I could feel that customer satisfaction was the utmost priority and that the team was ready to fulfil all requests even if out of the ""standard protocol""."
2237,,Van Hiep Hoang,Vietnam,8th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4,yes,10,BKK-FRA-BKK. LH 783 18 Dec BKK-FRA. LH 772 2 Jan FRA-BKK. Lufthansa continues to have fantastic economy service. The air hostesses tend to be older than other airlines but their experience shows in the brilliant service given. The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. The food is similar to others in the same category. You can even order cocktails on long haul flights and they even serve with a smile. My personal opinion is that elder stewardesses or stewards can give better service than younger ones. Seat is hard and small inflight entertainment is good with choices of quite contemporary film material. We wish there were more toilets.
2238,,Guder Petra,Germany,8th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,,3,yes,7,Very good and attentive service on 431 from ORD to FRA on January 3rd - even though it was economy class. The meal quality was bad completely tasteless chicken and the seats plus legroom too narrow too much of a sardine box feeling during a long distance flight.
2239,,Uwe Langhammer,United States,8th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,yes,7,IAD-FRA on B747-8 and FRA-IAH A380. Both flights were good. Friendliness in Business is much better than Economy. Good food and Service on both legs. Lounge in IAD with separate access gate to the plane is a plus. The new Business on the B747-8 let the old one on the A380 feel really outdated. It was hard to get a seat in the Z-Gate Business Lounge in FRA.
2240,,Uwe Langhammer,United States,8th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,2,yes,7,IAD-FRA on B747-8 and FRA-IAH A380. Both flights were good. Friendliness in Business is much better than Economy. Good food and Service on both legs. Lounge in IAD with separate access gate to the plane is a plus. The new Business on the B747-8 let the old one on the A380 feel really outdated. It was hard to get a seat in the Z-Gate Business Lounge in FRA.
2241,,Steegen Marc,Belgium,7th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,5,yes,10,Dusseldorf-Kiev return. Depart Düsseldorf Jan 1 2014 LH 3004. Return Kiev Jan 5 2014 LH 3005. Both flights on time service on board and catering very good. No inflight entertainment.
2242,,Karl Moosbrugger,Austria,7th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,10,DEL-FRA-SZB in Business. Check-in was easy the new lounge in Delhi has sufficient space free wifi and pretty good snacks and drinks. On board the lie-flat seats on the 747-800 were very comfortable and I had a good sleep. Flight was on-time and the breakfast before landing was very tasty (I had the Indian breakfast).
2243,,Guido Galley,Germany,7th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,LH456 from FRA to LAX on Jan 2 2014 with a Boeing 747-8 aircraft seat 1K. Excellent service and excellent food in the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and on the plane to LAX. Highly recommended! Everything was presented very well and the quality was perfect. I also like the Bose noise cancellation headphones that the seat is equipped with.
2244,,Ralf Schwimmbeck,United States,7th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,First Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,,3,yes,6,LH 419 from IAD to FRA. The lounge in IAD is less than average for First Class. The first Class seats are good and LH provides a heavy mattress and bedding to sleep. However LH has a policy of keeping the cabin at 23 deg C which is just too warm to sleep with all the heavy blankets I wish they would cool their cabin to a normal temp. The food was ok but certainly not great. The service from the flight staff was excellent. Finding my connection in Frankfurt was quite difficult and took quite a while to find the first class lounge.
2245,,M Taylor,Hong Kong,7th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,5,yes,10,Lufthansa continues to have fantastic economy service. The air hostesses tend to be older than other airlines but their experience shows in the brilliant service given. The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. Additionally the beer on board is better than other airlines Warsteiner. The food is similar to others in the same category - the only complaint is the number of films available. Perhaps there are 50 different films but compared to Etihad or others this falls a bit short by today's standards. I was on a new Boeing 747-8 which is rare as I almost always fly Airbus routes which may have made my trip more enjoyable.
2246,,Milan Zelcevic,Canada,6th January 2014,Lufthansa customer review,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4,yes,9,FRA-DXB return flight. Very good service on the way out. Good flight nice crew very uneventful. On the way back almost as good. The 747 landed in heavy clouds and didn't feel a thing. Entertainment is ok but not at the level of say Air Canada. On the way back I asked for lactose-free meal and got one that was pretty good. A great airline and a great experience.
